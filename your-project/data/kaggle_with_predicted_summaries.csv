Located at the Heritage Transport Museum, India's only transport museum, the steam engine was unveiled at the museum on Saturday.Home to about 2,500 curated vintage cars, buses, trains and pre-mechanised modes of transportation like bullock carts and even boats and an aviation gallery, the museum is the brainchild of Tarun Thakral, founder and managing trustee, and traces the evolution of modes of transport in India.""There aren't any steam engines operational because it's quite expensive. Even the toy trains work on diesel or battery. So, the younger genera-tion has no idea what a steam engine looks like or functions. This is an opportunity for them to see the same,"" says Tarun. The 12.5-ft tall and 31-ft long engine moved back and forth on the relatively small track, using wood to obtain the steam. The engine, originally built in 1953 by a German locomotive manufacturer, has been restored from its dilapidated condition in which it was found in Bihar. ""It took three months to restore it, while permissions and talks with the Indian Railways to acquire it took about three years. We are using wood here because coal quality is not good,"" says Tarun. This steam engine will be operational on special occasio-ns and one can also pay and get the engine moving, in case anyone wants a private experience.The museum, which opened in December 2013, after Tarun fell in love with cars. ""I needed space to store them and I had this land. So, I applied for permissions and decided to open a transport museum,"" concludes Tarun. ",16,"India's only existing steam engine was put on display at the Heritage Transport Museum in Haryana and was opened to the public on Saturday.

Sir John Thursby Community College in Burnley, Lancashire, reacted to concerns that some hijabs were being worn incorrectly by introducing a uniform version. However, the move has come under fire from some Muslim parents and pupils, who feel the uniform hijabs are uncomfortable and not modest enough. They have launched an online petition, signed by 150 people, protesting against the lack of consultation over the new uniformed hijab. ""Unfortunately, there was very little consultation by parents or the girls attending the school. Consequently, a scarf designed by the school has been created. It is very tight and in some cases too short as some of the girls have long hair and so it defeats the object to wear it,"" the petition reads. It also questions the ""real agenda"" behind the move and if it is to ""put girls off"" wearing a headscarf. Headmaster David Burton has written to parents to defend the policy and dismiss suggestions that the school is against headscarves as untrue. ""We are sorry that there have been suggestions that the school is against headscarves. This is not true. We respect fully the wishes of girls to wear a headscarf and we always have done,"" he said.

47,"Actor Naseeruddin Shah, while talking about the controversy around 'Lipstick Under My Burkha', said that one needs to ask a psychiatrist why the Censor Board is afraid of female sexuality on screen. He added, ""It's very frightening to see that the Censor Board can do whatever it wants and practise its biases openly and ban films that it doesn't like.""","Naseeruddin Shah has watched the film Lipstick Under My Burkha, starring his wife Ratna Pathak Shah, twice. And the veteran actor can?t figure out why the film was initially denied certification by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), aka Censor Board. ?I really don?t know what problem they had with the film. I think they have a problem with female sexuality being portrayed on screen. What the film?s success has done is that it has shown [the Censor Board] up, and what they thought about the film. I have seen the film twice, and it?s a wonderfully made film that talks about what?s going on in society. I don?t know why the Censor Board had a problem with that,? he quips. The CBFC letter informing the filmmakers that certification wouldn?t be given had called the film ?lady-oriented?, a perplexing word that drew much ridicule from filmmakers and actors. Afterwards, the Lipstick team got the required clearance from a parallel body. This has been one of the most high-profile tussles between the Censor Board and film teams in recent memory.With Lipstick?s release stalled for almost six months, director Alankrita Shrivastava and her team fought to get a clean chit, and finally received it from the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal, which asked for 16 cuts in the film. Naseeruddin Shah says, ?One has to ask a psychiatrist as to why they are afraid of [female sexuality] on screen.

But the success of such films prove that no one is bothered about what the Censor Board or the doubters think about [these] films.?Shah also criticises the Censor Board for being dictatorial. ?For starters,? he says, ?they are supposed to give a film a certificate; they are no authority to ban a film, or stay its release.

NBT chairman Baldeo Bhai Sharma said if reading habits are on the decline in the country, it is not because people are any less in love with books and reading, but because of other factors like lack of access and high costs associated with books, according to Sharma. Addressing the high costs associated with books, Sharma said they have spoken to publishers and distributors participating in the fair to try to offer books at discounted rates. ?We will also facilitate cashless transactions and digital payments, and have made arrangements for ATMs, including a mobile ATM, to ensure that business is not affected in the wake of demonetisation,? said Sharma.The ITPO has also collaborated with BSNL to ensure better network connectivity at the fair, so that digital transactions can happen with ease.Entry is free for senior citizens and children in school uniforms. ?We have discussed free entry passes with ITPO, because it is unfortunate that people will have to pay to enter the fair, where they come to buy books,? said Sharma.ITPO general manager SR Sahoo said they were considering issuing free passes from next year. ?General entry tickets will cost Rs 30 for adults and Rs 20 for children below 12 years of age.

Addressing the crowd, McGregor said, ""I'm going to knock him out inside of four rounds."" Later, Mayweather pointed out McGregor's three career losses by tapping out, saying, ""We know Mr Tapout like to quit and you will.""","Floyd Mayweather Jr and Conor McGregor met face to face on Tuesday for the first time, at least publicly, as they kicked off a four-city, three-country international press tour to drum up interest in their 12-round super welterweight matchup on 26 August at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.Both men lived up ? or down, depending on your perspective ? to their reputations as two of the most profane, outspoken trash-talkers in all of sports. Yet their collective showmanship, a side course in most contexts, is as essential an ingredient as ever as they promote an event that?s not expected to offer much in the way of authentic competition. It is, after all, a boxer widely considered the greatest of his generation against an opponent with no professional boxing experience. Regardless, the circus-like event is expected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. The price point for the pay-per-view telecast was announced on Monday: $89.95 for the standard-definition telecast, $99.95 for HD.McGregor, the two-division UFC champion from Dublin, was first on to the stage at the 21,000-seat home of the city?s pro basketball and hockey teams. He was dressed smartly in a pinstripe suit with a pink tie but he stood alone and exposed, as if he missed a cue. Surely, that was no accident. If the complete lack of UFC branding on the building wasn?t a clear enough signal: this was a Mayweather production.Moments later, Mayweather entered from the back of the room surrounded by his linebacker-sized bodyguards and entourage. He took the stage in a star-spangled The Money Team jumper, one that McGregor was quick to zero in on when he finally had his turn with the microphone after a brief introduction from Dana White, who never appeared more like a fifth wheel given how the UFC has been marginalized from the promotion.?He?s in a fucking track suit,? McGregor said to the delight of the crowd, before taking shots at Mayweather?s reported tax troubles. ?He can?t even afford a suit anymore! The Rolls is a 2012 outside. He is fooked!?Added McGregor: ?There?s no other way about it. His little legs, his little core, his little head. I?m going to knock him out inside of four rounds, mark my words.?The movement, the power, the ferociousness. He?s not experienced this. He?s fought people who have shied away from him. I don?t fear this limited set of fighting. This is a limited set of rules that makes this half a fight, a quarter of a fight. If this was a true fight, it wouldn?t even take one round. ... What can I say, I?m a young confident happy man that has worked extremely hard for this.?Mayweather absorbed McGregor?s verbal jabs from his chair, arms crossed, looking almost bored and disinterested. It?s a disposition many expect he?ll reprise in the later rounds of their 26 August meeting in which he?s been installed as a better than 10-1 favorite, but he came alive when the microphone came his way.After leading the crowd in his ?hard work, dedication? mantra, Mayweather?s unleashed a profane tirade as he stalked back and forth across the stage with the energy of a revivalist preacher.?You line ?em up and I knock ?em down like bowling pins,? he said. ?On August 26th, I?m gonna knock this bitch out too.?McGregor fired back from the side ? ?You haven?t knocked anyone out in about 20 years!? ? but only those watching from close range could hear it. Of course, his microphone had been switched off, undercutting the chances of the back-and-forth dialogue many had turned out for.?Dance for me, boy!? cried McGregor at one point. ?Dance for me, son!?Mayweather ignored the thinly veiled race-baiting, calling for an assistant to bring over a backpack from which he pulled out a $100m check ? ostensibly his payday from his 2015 blockbuster fight with Manny Pacquiao.?Give me that backpack!? Floyd shouts to an assistant, before pulling out a $100m check from his last fight.?He look good for for a seven-figure fighter, he look good for an eight-figure fighter,? Mayweather yelled to the crowd. ?But motherfucker, I?m a nine figure fighter. This bitch made three million dollars his last fight. But we know that?s training camp money for me.?McGregor fired back from his chair, saying that Mayweather should give the money to the US government.?You right, I?m the IRS,? Mayweather said, prepared for the line of attack. ?I?m gonna tax your ass.?He continued: ?I?m an old man. I?m not the same fighter I was 20 years ago, I?m not the same fighter I was 10 years ago, I?m not the same fighter I was five years ago, heck, I?m not the same fighter I was two years ago, but I can beat you.??We knew I was the A-side,? Mayweather said. ?That?s why it says Mayweather first. That?s why this bitch had to come to the boxing ring.?The American then took aim at McGregor?s three career losses by submission.?We know Mr Tapout like to quit and you will,? Mayweather said. ?You going out on your face or you going out on your back. Which way you want to go? Which way do you wanna go?McGregor paused for a beat, saying nothing. A tactical mistake.?That?s right, be quiet you little bitch.?Eventually, the fighters came together for the traditional staredown. Dana White was forced, it seemed, to separate them.Mayweather?s manager, Leonard Ellerbe, said attendance for the press conference was 11,000.

King Salman also urged citizens to monitor the abuse of power. Notably, one of the videos shows 18 bottles of whisky even though Saudi Arabia forbids alcohol consumption. ","A Saudi prince has been arrested after a video emerged online purporting to show him abusing someone and pointing a rifle at another.King Salman ordered the arrest and interrogation of the prince on Wednesday, a day after short clips were published on YouTube and shared on Twitter showing what appears to be a rifle pointed towards a man bleeding from the head and pleading.One video, viewed more than 760,000 times, shows 18 bottles of Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky on a table and a wad of cash. The sale and consumption of alcohol in Saudi Arabia is forbidden.Another shows a man sitting in a car, bleeding and being cursed at for parking in front of a house, while a further clip shows what appears to be the prince punching and slapping a man sitting on a chair.The clips went viral in Saudi Arabia under an Arabic Twitter hashtag that said ?prince transgresses on citizens?.???? ????? ????? ??? ???????? ???????.????? ?? ??? ???????? ???? ??? ???? ?????? ???????? ???? ?????? ????? .#????_?????_???_??????? pic.twitter.com/ImCsxwOtJeSaudi Arabia?s state TV reported on Wednesday that the king ordered a full investigation into the incidents and the arrest of Prince Saud bin Abdulaziz bin Musaed bin Saud bin Abdulaziz, as well as any associates who appeared in the clips. He ordered that no individual involved in the case be released until a court had issued a ruling in line with the country?s sharia laws.In the order, King Salman urged people to remain vigilant in monitoring any exploitation of status or abuse of power.After he issued the order, a video seen nearly 250,000 times showed the young, low-level prince, dressed in a black T-shirt and grey jogging bottoms, handcuffed and with his feet chained, being escorted into a building by security officers.While many Saudis wrote in support of the king?s decision on Twitter, the outspoken rights activist Moudi Aljohani said the order pointed to how lax the authorities were when it came to royals.The arrest comes a day after state media reported that a woman filmed walking around a historic Saudi fort in a miniskirt and crop top sparked outrage among conservatives for defying the kingdom?s dress code for women, which requires females in public to cover themselves in long, loose robes. The outcry prompted police to detain and question her for several hours before she was released without charge.While Saudi royals are given privileged status in the kingdom, in addition to undisclosed monthly allowances from the state, they are not immune to prosecution. In an extremely rare event, the kingdom executed a prince last October who had fatally shot another man. Saudi Arabia has one of the highest rates of executions in the world.Since ascending to the throne in 2015, King Salman has branded himself a ?decisive? leader. He has fired ministers caught on video being rude or insulting citizens. He also fired a senior royal court official who was filmed slapping a photographer.Before becoming king, Salman served as the governor of the capital, Riyadh, and as defence minister. A leaked 2007 US embassy memo said he ?is often the referee in family disputes?.

The change in fielding restrictions in the last 10 overs of a one-day international has eased the pressure on the bowlers a little bit, but only a little bit,"" he said.""...but for the most part, the bowlers are pretty much second-class citizens in white-ball cricket,"" he added.Bond said it is this imbalance which has led to spinners using negative tactics.""The slow bowlers specifically are resorting to a more negative line of bowling, not because they want to but because they have to,"" he said.""In an era gone by, the pattern was to tee-off in the first 15 overs, build through the middle of the innings and then launch a final onslaught.

Therefore, it becomes vital to use that weapon judiciously.""You must have the ability to change the length? bowl the yorker, yes, but also use the bouncer, the slower ball, the length ball,"" he opined.""You dont bowl the full ball to certain batsmen, you dont bang it in to certain others. All of it is very much opposition, ground, conditions and batter-dependent. If you are off even marginally, the yorker is probably the easiest ball to hit for a four or a six.

I lie for a living. However, it has been a while and maybe it is time,? he added.Depp, who arrived in a blue vintage Cadillac, was greeted with crowds of screaming fans holding phones.He smoked a cigarette as he posed for pictures and jumped on the car bonnet without prompting.

The NTCA has stated that all tiger deaths will be treated as poaching unless proven otherwise, making it 65% of the total deaths this year.","The euphoria over rise in world tiger population early this year may have been misplaced for India as the official data placed before Parliament shows that 98 tigers died in the country till November 16, 2016, a steep 25 per cent rise over last year when 78 deaths were reported.The figures collected by National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) also take the wind out of government efforts to encourage tiger foundations for sensitising the public and fighting poachers to save the big cats.

Cradles will be accompanied by a bell to notify the authorities at the premises. WCD Minister Maneka Gandhi called it a 'humane and anonymous method' for parents to put babies up for adoption.","For years, poverty along with the cultural bent to favour boys has led to Indian parents abandoning babies in dumpsters, hedges, train tracks and even rivers or lakes where few of them survive.But they can now make a more humane choice. Offering a solution to hapless parents who are unable to bring up their newborns, the women and child development (WCD) ministry will now keep cradles at government hospitals, orphanages and police stations across the country where one can leave their child behind for adoption. The cradle will be accompanied by a bell, which a person can ring to notify authorities at the premises after dropping off a baby.""It is a simple, humane and anonymous method for parents who are unable to look after their child and have to unwillingly part ways with them,"" WCD minister Maneka Gandhi told Mail Today. ""By leaving their child behind in a cradle, parents will knowingly put their child up for adoption.""TO FILL THE GAPThe move came after the ministry found it difficult to bridge the gap between 600 kids up for adoption and 14,000 requests. The department's statutory body, Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA), functions as the nodal agency for adoption of Indian children and is mandated to monitor and regulate adoptions in India as well as abroad.The government's decision also comes as a blessing for childless people and couples. ""This will prove to be a safe place for orphaned, abandoned and surrendered children,"" said a senior ministry official.After a hospital or orphanage is notified by the ringing bell, officials will take the child into custody and he or she will handed over to the area's child welfare committee. The panel will further screen the child and decide if the baby is fit for adoption.REASONS FOR ABANDONMENTThe reasons for abandonment vary: an unwed mother facing social stigma; parents unable to look after their child, often because it is mentally or physically ill; or simply not wanting a girl. The ""surrendered children"" fail to get registered under the adoption list and in the process bring down the number of children ideal for the purpose.The official added the ministry will prioritise adoption demands by single mothers as well as economically welloff mothers and women who are over child- bearing age. While critics argue it could create more problems than it solves, such as increase abandonment, other analysts maintain that forcing parents to keep unwanted children can lead to abuse and infanticide.The WCD ministry has identified private and government hospitals and orphanages as prime locations to place the cradles. Ministry officials are yet to place police stations in the same ambit, citing complications of taking care of infants at such spots and are awaiting the approval of ministry of home affairs for this.WCD ministry officials pointed out that the cradles will help eliminate the guilt and social pressure stifling parents. It will also aid the government in ensuring that a child goes to a family with a good house.Gandhi was inspired during her trip to a child care institution in Guwahati where she saw infants put up for adoption.

203,"A 14-year-old Mumbai boy killed himself on Saturday after jumping off the terrace of a seven-storey building. Police suspect that the boy was addicted to the online game 'Blue Whale' which demands players to complete 50 tasks in 50 days, with the last task being committing suicide. However, the police is officially yet to find the reason for his suicide.","A 14-year-old boy in Andheri, a suburb of Mumbai, killed himself this weekend, jumping off the terrace of his seven-floor building on Saturday. Sources within the Mumbai Police tell India Today that the boy is believed to have been addicted to an online game known as 'Blue Whale'. Blue Whale is a challenge-based underground game with a shadowy history, and has previously been linked to suicides in Russia and other countries. However, officially, Mumbai Police has said that it is yet to find the reason behind the 14-year-old Andheri boy's suicide.The boy, a 9th standard student of an international school in Andheri, is survived by his parents and two sisters. He dreamed of becoming a pilot and had expressed a desire to go to Russia for training. On Saturday, a neighbour from a building adjoining the boy's spotted the teenager on the terrace, walking on parapet while shooting what seemed to be a selfie video. The boy then jumped off and killed himself.  The Mumbai Police have registered an accidental death report (ADR) in the matter and have ruled it to be a clear case of suicide.Cops, however, refused to confirm whether the suicide was linked to Blue Whale. Speaking to India Today, DCP Navinchandra Reddy said, ""The parents have not given any information on the reason of suicide, they are in state of shock. We are investigating the case in all possible angles (sic).""BLUE WHALEBlue Whale is a video game said to have originated in Russia and its creator was reportedly arrested by Russian police earlier this year. The game gives players a series of 50 quests, with the final task asking them to commit suicide. The game also asks players to document the completion of each task in the form of photographs. The players are supposed to send the evidence of their completion to the game's administrator who then qualifies them to attempt the next task. Blue Whale's tasks range from the seemingly harmless - watching a scary video at 4 am - to the disturbing - writing/drawing on arms with a sharp object.For the final task, players are directed to jump off a terrace building while, again, documenting the act in the form of photos/video.  According to media reports, Blue Whale has spread across several countries and taken lives of hundreds of teenagers. However, the Andheri suicide would likely be the first such case in India.Following the suicide, a WhatsApp message warning parents about Blue Whale has begun to do the rounds in Mumbai. The message, seen by India Today, references the Andheri suicide to say that parents should be wary of handing their children mobile phones or other devices that could allow them to access the online challenge.",22,"A 14-year-old Mumbai boy killed himself on Saturday after jumping off the terrace of a seven-storey building.

As per the 2011 census, the Christian population in Jharkhand rose by a whopping 29.7% in the last 10 years followed by that of Muslims 28.4%, while Hindu population rose by 21%.To begin with, the government curbed the flow of government funds to various Christian affiliate social organisations and development groups that were allegedly misusing government money to convert people.Chief minister Das has voiced his concerns over the conversion of tribals through force or allurement on several occasions, and asked gullible tribals to protect their culture and religious practices at any cost.?Those indulging in forcible religious conversion would not be spared,?

""The old leadership continues to provide strategic guidance, Ayman al-Zawahiri issues overall direction to the network, and leadership attrition has compelled al-Qaida to reveal a deeper bench than we knew it was there before,"" she said.

Rahane was the captain during India's series winning Test against Australia at Dharamsala. However in Champions Trophy, he did not get to play a single match and had to perform the duties of a 12th man. But in the West Indies series that followed, he emerged as the top run-getter with Man of the Series award.""If I am the vice-captain of the Test team, it does not mean that I will not be performing my duties as a 12th man in ODIs. The moment you are representing your country, you are supposed to do whatever you are assigned. When I was carrying drinks during the Champions Trophy, I had no ego issues. That's how I am as a person,"" Rahane said.The elegant right-hander made a successful comeback into the ODI playing XI with 336 runs from five ODIs at an average of 67.20 including a hundred and three half-centuries. ""West Indies was a special series for me simply for the consistency that I was able to show. This series is an important one for my ODI career and getting runs in almost all the matches was a really satisfying feeling. I got opportunity to show a different side to my batting and express myself differently,"" said Rahane.For Rahane, more than technical, there were mental adjustments that were really very necessary. Asked to elaborate, Rahane said: ""By instinct, I am an attacking batsman but the pitches in the West Indies required a different mindset. It required patience and at times not get enticed to go for the big ones. Discretion was necessary in shot selection.""And when we talk about discretion, that's where the mind comes into play - to be able to think clearly what are the shots that I am going to play in a particular situation, on a particular kind of pitch,"" he said.For him, what made the knocks special was the pitches in the West Indies which weren't exactly batting friendly with the ones in Port of Spain and Antigua creating difficulties.""Actually the 62 that I got in the first ODI (abandoned due to rain), gave me a lot of confidence. It was my comeback match. I wanted to have a good knock under my belt. Once I got those runs, the second match was even better when I scored that century. The pitches were sluggish in nature and each pitch was so different from one another,"" he stated.The soft-spoken Rahane said that not for once did he feel insecured because he was coming in place of a rested Rohit Sharma, who is again expected to open the innings during the Sri Lanka ODIs.""This is a great phase in Indian cricket where we have so many top quality players competing for a place in the Indian team. It's always good to have competition.

The Delhi Durbar on December 12, 1911 was marked as a celebration of the coronation of King Emperor George V. Delhi had witnessed two such durbars before, in 1877 and 1903, but the Delhi Durbar of 1911 assumed unusual importance as King George V announced the shifting of British India's capital from Calcutta to Delhi.As chronicled by HT over the past year in the series New Delhi 100, Delhi in 1911 was just a small town in the Punjab province, still recovering from the wounds inflicted on it by the British regime after the uprising of 1857. But the king's proclamation at the durbar, kept a secret till then, changed Delhi's fate and put it firmly on the international political map.Calcutta, the nerve centre of British Raj till then, had fallen out of favour as it had become politically volatile. The British government wanted to shift the capital and Delhi won on many counts. It was closer to Shimla, the summer capital and was well connected by rail.In the next 20 years, New Delhi would be carved out of scattered villages and a rocky ridge inhabited by jackals. The new capital and its imposing buildings would come to define Delhi for the next 100 years.

This time, the National Award-winning filmmaker delves into the murky world of Delhi and the unconventional relationships that take wing in the shadow of the city?s high-class lifestyle, with Shab. With his brilliant understanding of human emotions, Onir takes a leap into the ?forbidden? love stories of the society with his latest venture.Shab traces the lives of four characters - their personal struggles and love lives. Mohan (Ashish Bisht) is a small-towner who travels from Dhanaulti to Delhi with the hope of becoming a successful model. He is rejected at a talent hunt after being mocked for his ?lack of finnese? and is ridiculed for his broken English. One of the judges, however, finds her fantasy in this young man and there starts our first love story. She is Sonal Modi (Raveena Tandon), a rich trophy wife whose husband has no interest in her life. She decides to make Mohan her boy-toy. Meanwhile, Mohan meets Raina (Arpita Chatterjee) and Neel (Areesz Gandii) who appear to be caring, helpful and hard-working people and offer him all the help he needs. While Neel is recovering from a broken relationship, Raina appears to be mostly concerned about her younger sister?s well-being even as she nurtures some darker secrets. Onir?s expertise is seen in the way he handles these characters and their stories - his sensible filmmaking is written all over the frames. Even when showing stereotypical mindsets in our society, he makes it a point to balance out the narrow-minded comments by placing sane-minded characters nearby, giving them at least one or two jibes to throw at the prejudiced characters. Shab is the darkest film Onir has made till date. With the film, he explores the ?morally wrong? shades of human relationship without letting the audience hold any judgments - he shows us the emotional turmoils of people in these relationships. Though the reason behind such endeavours is revealed much later in the film, what we get to witness, are the everyday struggles. Of the four main characters, Onir seems to give a bigger window into the hearts of Mohan and Sonal. Raveena Tandon has given one of her most sensual, brilliant performances in Shab. She manages to bring out every single element of a rich and lonely trophy wife who does not shy away from paying up for the love she desires. She is authoritative, demanding and dominant when Mohan but becomes a loyal, caring wife when sitting beside her husband (Sanjay Suri) in a party. Her last scene, where she is told that her credit card is blocked, is something you will appreciate the most. When asked to pay up later at a hotel, she takes off her jewelry, places them at the counter and tells the man behind the cash counter, ?Tell my husband that her wife has kept all this for guarantee?. And the masterstroke comes when she places her heels at the counter as well. Ashish has an air of innocence about his presence that adds to the credibility of his character and makes his efforts shine through. Shab is a dark, haunting film about human emotions, relationships, love and betrayal that thrive in a rather opportunistic and materialistic world of Delhi?s elite society.

572,"UK's National Health Service (NHS) has announced plans to stop doctors from prescribing homeopathic remedies. Aiming to save around £200 million a year, the NHS chief described homeopathy as ?at best a placebo and a misuse of funds?. The plans also list 17 other items that will no longer be prescribed for reasons ranging from low clinical to low cost-effectiveness.","Homeopathic remedies will no longer be available on prescription on the NHS according to newly-announced plans.The move comes as part of the NHS England?s drive to save more than £190m a year through a new set of national guidelines, which are now open for public consultation. According to the draft consultation, prescriptions for homeopathic treatments cost NHS England £92,412 in 2016, and at least £578,000 over the past five years.Announcing the plans, Simon Stevens, NHS England?s chief executive, said homeopathy is ?at best a placebo and a misuse of scarce NHS funds?.Besides homeopathy, the plans highlight 17 other items that will no longer be available on prescription for reasons ranging from low clinical effectiveness to low cost-effectiveness. These include herbal medicines, Omega-3 fatty acid compounds, rubs and ointments used to relieve muscle pain known as rubefacients, and travel vaccines including hepatitis B, yellow fever and rabies that are not available on the NHS for travel, but are sometimes erroneously given.The public funding of homeopathic remedies has long been controversial, with both the British Medical Association and the House of Commons? science and technology committee having called for an end to their prescription on NHS, pointing out that such remedies are merely placebos. The new guidelines were welcomed by experts.?Homeopathy is based on implausible assumptions and the most reliable evidence fails to show that it works beyond a placebo effect. It can cause severe harm when used as an alternative to effective treatments,? said Edzard Ernst, emeritus professor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter. ?Therefore, it is high time that the NHS stops funding it and instead employs our scarce resources on treatments that are backed by sound science.?The view was echoed by Michael Marshall, project director of the Good Thinking Society, an organisation that previously threatened the Department of Health with a judicial review if it failed to put complementary and alternative therapies on the blacklist for prescriptions.?This is very welcome news,? said Marshall. ?Every credible medical body certainly knows that homeopathic remedies are just not effective for any conditions at all and it is great to see this strong statement from NHS England officially acknowledging the fact.? Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, said that an honest conversation about public funding of drugs was needed. ?We need to end unnecessary expense to give us a bigger therapeutic bang for the NHS buck, so we cut the fat and build the therapeutic muscle,? he said.A spokeswoman for the BMA said the organisation ?believes there should be no further NHS funding for homeopathy? adding that ?limited and scarce NHS resources should only be used to support medicines and treatment that have been shown to be effective.?But Cristal Sumner, chief executive of the British Homeopathic Association said the NHS plans were ?bad for its already overstretched budget and for patients? and criticised the report used to draw up the new guidelines.?This recommendation is not cost effective as patients will be prescribed more expensive conventional drugs in place of homeopathy, which defeats the object of the exercise,? she said.Meanwhile, NHS England has been accused of introducing ?ability to pay? through the back door by forcing patients to pay for other products it claims are ?ineffective, over-priced and low value?, instead of giving prescriptions for them. Health charities claim the NHS is abandoning the historic principle that people who need care should not have to pay. The charge has been made today by National Voices, an umbrella group that represents 140 health and care charities including the British Heart Foundation, Parkinson?s UK and Arthritis Care. It was responding to NHS England?s announcement that it wants to cut its drugs bill by several hundred million pounds by no longer issuing prescriptions for cough mixture, cold treatments, eye drops, laxatives and sun cream ? products that are available over the counter. NHS bosses want those in need to pay for such medications themselves. ?There are many patients who would be unable to afford the remedies over the counter ? for example people who are exempt from prescription charges such as the under-16s, people living with cancer, pregnant women and those on low incomes?, said Don Redding, National Voices? director of policy. ?Stopping such prescriptions would be tantamount to introducing ?ability to pay? as a barrier to accessing the treatments people need. This breaks with the principle of ?free at the point of use? guaranteed by the NHS constitution.? The NHS constitution states that: ?Access to NHS services is based on clinical need, not an individual?s ability to pay; NHS services are free of charge, except in limited circumstances sanctioned by parliament.?

Metro 2A ( Dahisar to DN Nagar), Metro 2B ( DN Nagar-Bandra-Mankhurd), Metro 4 (Wadala Ghatkopar Mulund Kasaravadavali) and Metro 7 covering (Dahisar East-Andheri East). The cabinet also allowed the use of a plot reserved for playground to build an underground station for Metro 3. These decisions were cleared in the cabinet meeting held on Sunday, on the eve of the monsoon session of the Maharashtra legislature.The state cabinet approved bank guarantee for Metro 4 being funded by Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. It has further decided to provide a debt sustainability certificate (DSC) to three other Metro projects ? Metro 2A, 2B and 7 being funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The cost of Metro 4 is Rs14,549 crore, while the cost of the rest of the three projects is Rs6,410 crore, Rs10,986 crore and Rs6,208 crore respectively. The DSC is mandatory to sanction externally aided projects that are to get funding from multilateral agencies like the ADB and World Bank. The bank guarantees and the debt sustainability certificates from the state government to the Metro projects will help formalise loan agreements for four of the Metro corridors with international funding agencies. Only after the loan agreements are inked, one can say the financing of these projects is complete. This will also ensure that work on the Metro projects is not held up for want of money.?We plan to complete Metro 7 and Metro 2A by the 2019 Assembly elections. While civil work is being funded by the MMRDA, financing for the rolling stock, signaling systems etc is possible only through the loan. So formalising these loan agreements is important for us,?? said a senior state government official. For the fully underground Metro 3 project, a 554-sqm plot located at Tardeo currently reserved as a playground was required to develop an underground ?Grant Road? station. As the plot was reserved for a playground, it required the government?s approval to build an underground station. The cabinet approved the proposal speeding up work on the Metro 3 corridor as well. This corridor is likely to be completed by 2020-21. Metro-3 is a 33.5-km underground corridor that will link Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ in Andheri (East).

These libraries are unique in their own way as they have been put together from the citizen local area development fund, or Swaraj fund, and were taken up after people chose them as priority projects in mohalla sabhas conducted in various assembly constituencies last year. Though the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has started working on projects promised during the Mohalla Sabhas, the fate of Swaraj fund for the current fiscal (2016-17) itself hangs in balance.Officials say that the constitution of mohalla sabhas and creating a project management unit under it are yet to get approval from the Lieutenant Governor. The fate of Rs 350 crore, allocated under Swaraj fund in the annual budget, hence, by the AAP government remains unclear. With only three months left in the current fiscal, officials said they were not sure if funds will be utilised at all this year.?The process of holding mohalla sabhas across the city and then implementing the projects chosen as priority is a long-drawn one. Eight public libraries, construction of which were decided in mohalla sabhas in Karawal Nagar assembly constituency on a pilot basis last fiscal (2015-16), will be inaugurated on Sunday. Any delay in approval could lead to lapse of funds this year,? said a senior revenue department official. In June, the Arvind Kejriwal cabinet had cleared a proposal to constitute 2,972 mohalla sabhas, besides creating a project management unit (PMU) called Mission Swaraj to co-ordinate the entire project. Both proposals were then sent to the L-G for his approval. Mohalla sabhas were conducted in 11 assembly segments including Karawal Nagar in May last year. Development works worth R 50 lakh in each of the 11 assembly segment were decided in these meetings. Karwal Nagar MLA and water minister Kapil Mishra said the government had not lost hope on holding such sabhas before the end of this fiscal. ?The initiative is a unique step to ensure citizen participation in governance. It would be for the first time that eight libraries in an assembly segment are coming up, which was actually decided by area residents themselves. Even if the L-G clears the approval now, the government will at least hold these sabhas,? said Mishra.

Royal said.The alternating traffic rule ? in which cars with odd or even registration plates are banned from cities ? was enforced for a record four days in Paris last week. It was dropped after the pollution improved over the weekend when the roads were less busy. But Airparif, which monitors air quality in the French capital, warned that the smog, which led to a rise in asthma and hospital admissions for breathing difficulties and caused schools to cancel outdoor sports, could return with the rush-hour traffic on Monday.Other measures announced include an extension of the ?superbonus scheme? in which vehicle owners can obtain a ?10,000 (£8,400) payment for changing an old polluting vehicle for an electric one.

""This is a proxy war and proxy war is a dirty war. It is played in a dirty way. The rules of engagements are there when the adversary comes face-to-face and fights with you. It is a dirty war.... That is where innovation comes in. You fight a dirty war with innovations,"" Rawat told PTI.""People are throwing stones at us, people are throwing petrol bombs at us. If my men ask me what do we do, should I say, just wait and die? I will come with a nice coffin with a national flag and I will send your bodies home with honour. Is it what I am supposed to tell them as chief? I have to maintain the morale of my troops who are operating there,"" Gen Rawat said.Rawat went on to indicate that stone pelters had complicated the security situation in Kashmir, saying his force would find it easier to quell protests if instead of stones, weapons were used.  ""In fact, I wish these people, instead of throwing stones at us, were firing weapons at us. Then I would have been happy. Then I could do what I (want to do),"" Rawat told PTI.Saying that the Army cannot run away from its role to provide security, Rawat said, ""Tomorrow elections have to be held in Anantnag and similar things may happen. If the army does not respond to call for assistance, then the trust between the people whom we are protecting, police and army will break."" ""That is something I cannot allow to happen. This is what the militants want. It can create a divide between the army and other security forces,"" he said.'NEED TO FEAR THE ARMY'He added that the Indian Army is a friendly force and is practising maximum restraint to deal with the Kashmir situation. Rawat noted that the force can only do its job if the country fears it. ""Adversaries must be afraid of you and at the same time your people must be afraid of you. We are a friendly army, but when we are called to restore law and order, people have to be afraid of us,"" he said.Rawat also spoke about the core issue of Kashmir, saying that it is something that needs a composite solution and is a process in which everybody will have to get involved. ""It will have to be a composite solution. Everybody will have to get involved. Army's role is to ensure that violence does not take place and the common man who is not indulging in this (violence) is protected,"" he said, when asked about the solution to the Kashmir issue.HUMAN SHIELD CONTROVERSY The Army chief's statements come days after Major Leetul Gogoi of the 53 Rashtriya Rifles was awarded a Commendation Card by General Rawat for the former's role in countering insurgency in Kashmir.In his PTI interview, Rawat said that Gogoi's commendation was awarded with the aim of boosting the morale of his troops. ""As Army Chief my concern is morale of the Army. That is my job. I am far away from the battle field. I cannot influence the situation there. I can only tell the boys that I am with you. I always tell my people, things will go wrong, but if things have gone wrong and you did not have malafide intent, I am there,"" he said.Major Gogoi is the same officer who sparked nationwide controversy after tying a Kashmiri local to an Army jeep. Gogoi, in a statement delivered recently, said his actions were aimed at saving the lives of the men under his command as well as those of stone pelters in Kashmir. On April 9, the day of polling for the Srinagar Parliamentary bypoll, Major Gogoi and his team were called to the Utligam polling both to rescue civilian and security personnel trapped at the location. Major Gogoi said that around 1,200 protesters had surrounded the booth and in order to escape from the booth, with the people he had just rescued, he grabbed a person he believed to be the ring leader of the protesters and got him tied to a jeep. The man - Farooq Ahmad Dar - has denied that he was a stone pelter. Gogoi and his team then drove the jeep with Dar tied to it out of the area. A video of the incident, shared by former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, went viral on social media and caused a huge controversy, forcing the Army to set up a Court of Inquiry into the incident. Sources previously told India Today that the CoI has not found Major Gogoi to be at fault. Gogoi continues to serve the Rashtriya Rifles unit.However, Rawat told PTI he has a general idea about what is going on in the Court of Inquiry and that is why he went ahead with awarding the Major. ""I know what is happening in the COI. It is being finalised. What do we punish him for.""UNREST IN KASHMIRRawat's comments come amid concerns of widespread unrest in the Kashmir Valley following Saturday's killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Sabzar Ahmad Bhat. Bhat, the successor of Burhan Wani, was killed on Saturday in an Indian Army operation. Wani's death had sparked months of violent unrest in Kashmir leading to the deaths of more than 100 civilians. Officials have however expressed confidence that a repeat of the post-Wani violence won't happen as the establishment is prepared to deal with stone pelters.

In the essay, Williams said that for every dollar earned by men in the United States, black women earn just 63 cents. ""The cycles of poverty, discrimination and sexism are much, much harder to break than the Grand Slam titles record,"" Williams wrote.","Serena Williams, one of the highest paid and most successful athletes in the world, has issued a stirring call for black women to demand equal pay and spoken about the racism she has faced ?on and off the tennis court?.In a personal essay published by Fortune to coincide with Black Women?s Equal Pay Day, the tennis superstar said the gender pay gap ?hits women of colour the hardest?, as they suffer from both gender and racial financial disparity. For every dollar earned by men in the US, Williams said, black women earn 63 cents, and 17% less than white women.Her comments come as pay gaps are examined in a range of industries after the BBC was engulfed in scandal when it published a list of its top earners in July.Williams, a 23-times grand slam winner, wrote that black women have to work eight months longer to earn the same ?as their male counterparts do in one year?, and drew on her own experiences to highlight the unfair treatment of black women in the workplace. ?I?ve been disrespected by my male colleagues and ? in the most painful times ? I?ve been the subject of racist remarks on and off the tennis court,? she wrote.Williams has repeatedly been the target of sexist and racist remarks by men in tennis. In 2016 the chief executive of the Indian Wells tennis tournament, Raymond Moore, said women?s tennis was riding on the coat-tails of the men?s tour and that female players should ?thank god? for Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. In April the Romanian team captain, Ilie Nastase, made an apparently racist comment about Williams?s unborn baby and was heard calling her and Johanna Konta ?fucking bitches?. Most recently, former champion John McEnroe said Williams would ?be, like, 700 in the world? if she played on the men?s tour. ?Luckily I am blessed with an inner drive and a support system of family and friends that encourage me to move forward. But these injustices still hurt,? Williams wrote.July 31 is Black Women's Equal Pay Day. Black women are the cornerstone of our communities, they are phenomenal, and they deserve equal pay. pic.twitter.com/XOHyIdbYPcNoting that she is ?in the rare position to be financially successful beyond my imagination?, Williams said that, if she had not been lucky enough to pick up a tennis racquet and break through, she would be like the other 24 million black women facing wage disparities in the US.?The cycles of poverty, discrimination and sexism are much, much harder to break than the record for Grand Slam titles,? she wrote. ?For every black woman that rises through the ranks to a position of power, there are too many others who are still struggling.?She said that changing the status quo would take courage to push the issue into the spotlight and force employers to compensate female employees equally: ?We deserve equal pay for our mothers, our wives, our daughters, our nieces, friends, and colleagues ? but mostly for ourselves.?Black women: be fearless. Speak out for equal pay. Every time you do, you?re making it a little easier for a woman behind you. Let?s get back those 37 cents.?Black Women?s Equal Pay Day, on 31 July, marked how long into 2017 an African American woman would have to work to be paid the same wages as her white male counterpart last year. ?Despite the large gender disadvantage faced by all women, black women were near parity with white women in 1979,? the Economic Policy Institute said. ?However in 2016, white women?s wages grew to 76% of white men?s, compared to 67% for black women relative to white men ? a racial difference of nine percentage points. The trend is going the wrong way ? progress is slowing for black women.?In the UK, research by the Fawcett Society in March revealed a similar story, that many minority ethnic women were ?left behind? by progress on the pay gap. Black African women in the UK have seen virtually no progress since the 1990s in closing the gender pay gap with white British men, with a full-time pay gap of 21.4% in the 1990s and 19.6% today. ?Black African women have been largely left behind, and in terms of closing the pay gap, Pakistani and Bangladeshi women are today only where white British women were in the 1990s,? Sam Smethers, the charity?s chief executive, said.The low number of staff from ethnic minorities on the BBC?s list of its best-paid talent has also provoked an angry response inside the corporation, after no black or ethnic minority staff featured among those earning the top 24 salaries. Williams has been a consistent advocate of equal pay. Earlier this month, when asked about what she would want for her child, she said: ?If my daughter were to play in a sport and she was able to have equal prize money, or equal pay, or equal rights, I feel like that would be a success. And if not, I would really want her to speak up for it. Any daughter of mine will have a voice.?She also praised Andy Murray after he corrected a journalist who said Sam Querrey was ?the first US player to reach a major semi-final since 2009?.

Also the party was far behind the target of adding 1.5 lakh new members to the party.Even after a BJP leader present in the meeting told Shah that the party would get 41 per cent votes in a triangular fight in Delhi if elections were held immediately, Shah - who had a target of 51 per cent in Delhi- was not convinced. The leaders gave a detailed presentation on the voting pattern, caste equations and demographic division in the Capital and also the factors that led to BJP's successive defeats in elections. Shah also directed the state leadership to improve its presence at the booth level to strike good rapport with the voters.During the meeting, some among the party leaders also cited lack of coordination between office bearers and the subordinates. Taking strong note of this, Shah directed Delhi BJP general secretary Kuljeet Chahal to put before him all communication sent from the central office ever since he became the BJP president in August 2014.He also took note of the complaints that the communications from central leadership was not circulated to party workers at the district and block levels.An action report has been sought regarding all communications on Saturday.",21,"BJP President Amit Shah has expressed displeasure over the state of affairs in the BJP's Delhi unit at a meeting with the unit's office-bearers.

2896,"Researchers at the University of Central Florida have developed an anti-glare film that could allow people to read from their smartphones and tablets even in bright sunlight. The coating is inspired by the nanostructures that cover moth eyes and prevent light from reflecting off them. The flexible, self-cleaning coating increases readability by up to 10 times in different lighting conditions.","Washington, Jun 23 (PTI) Inspired by the nanostructures found on moth eyes, scientists have developed a new anti- reflection film that could allow people to read from their smartphones and tablets even in bright sunlight. The film exhibits a surface reflection of just 0.23 per cent, much lower than the iPhones surface reflection of 4.4 per cent, for example. Reflection is the major reason it is difficult to read a phone screen in bright sunlight, as the strong light reflecting off the screens surface washes out the display. ""Using our flexible anti-reflection film on smartphones and tablets will make the screen bright and sharp, even when viewed outside,"" said Shin-Tson Wu from the University of Central Florida in the US. ""In addition to exhibiting low reflection, our nature- inspired film is also scratch resistant and self-cleaning, which would protect touch screens from dust and fingerprints,"" said Wu, who led the study published in the journal Optica. The new film contains tiny uniform dimples, each about 100 nanometres in diameter (about one-thousandth of the width of a human hair). The coating can also be used with flexible display applications such as phones with screens that fold like a book, which are expected to hit the market as soon as next year. Many of todays smartphones use a sensor to detect bright ambient light and then boost the screens brightness level enough to overcome the strong surface reflection. Although this type of adaptive brightness control can help improve readability, it also drains battery power. Other methods for solving the sunlight visibility problem have proved difficult to implement. Looking for a simpler approach to improve screen readability outside, the researchers turned to nature. The eyes of moths are covered with a pattern of antireflective nanostructures that allow moths to see in the dark and prevent eye reflections that might be seen by predators. The researchers developed a fabrication technique that uses self-assembled nanospheres to form a precise template that can be used to create the moth-eye-like structure on a coating.

They have arrested four engineering college dropouts for their involvement in the scam called 'Bottom fishing'.The cyber criminals have cheated several people not just in the state but across the nation as well.

They are all natives of Bokaro steel City. As of today, the police have recovered 460 SIM cards, 15 mobiles, laptops, hard disks, data cards and forged and original identity proof documents.The accused further more had a database consisting of details and credentials of more than 16,000 bank accounts.

Reportedly, ?10 fine will be levied for delay up to a year and ?50 beyond that.","The Uttar Pradesh cabinet on Tuesday approved a proposal to make registration of marriages compulsory for every resident of the state, regardless of religion or community.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath presided over a cabinet meeting to adopt the Uttar Pradesh Marriage Registration Rules-2017, which stipulates compulsory registration of marital alliances and lays down penalties for any delay in this regard. Though the fines are not particularly hefty ? Rs 10 for delay up to a year and Rs 50 beyond that period ? it is liable to increase over time. ?We took all sections of society into confidence before taking a decision on the issue,? health minister Siddharth Nath Singh told mediapersons later in the day.However, Singh admitted that the cabinet did not concede to demands from a few Muslim clerics who wanted their community exempt from having to furnish photographs of the bride and groom. ?Yes, they made such a demand because the nikahnama (the Islamic marriage contract) does not carry images. But if photographs can be submitted to procure documents such as Aadhaar cards, I don?t see why the same cannot be done for marriage registration,? he said.While the stamps and registration department will double as the nodal agency for marriage registration, the government will launch an online portal to ensure easy access. The Centre had already made marriage registration compulsory across the country, in keeping with a 2006 Supreme Court ruling. Uttar Pradesh was among the only two states that had failed to implement the directive, an anomaly that minister for women welfare and tourism development Rita Bahuguna Joshi had earlier vowed to rectify. ?We will implement the Supreme Court?s order in the state. A cabinet note is being prepared, and the same will be sent for the cabinet?s approval,? she had said.The erstwhile Samajwadi Party government had deferred taking a decision on the matter in view of strong objections from Muslims.

Over the last 2-3 years, with all the capital coming..., our entire industry, including ourselves, started making mistakes."" ""All of us starting with myself and Rohit, are to blame for it,"" it added. ","Snapdeal is going through tough times. Today we heard that the company cut 600 jobs and that there is a lot of confusion and chaos in its offices. Also the company founders have taken a full, which means 100 per cent, salary cut. The gravity of the situation can be ascertained from the email that Snapdeal founders have presumably written to the company employees. It has been leaked and posted on Pastebin so far now we are not completely sure that this is the complete and genuine email. But it sure seems to have come from the founders. Here is the full text:--At Snapdeal, we find ourselves at an important point in our journey - we know where we want to go and now is the time to make the choices of how we will get there.Has our company and industry been going through a troubled time? Absolutely. Did we make errors in our execution? No doubt about that. Over the last 2-3 years, with all the capital coming into this market, our entire industry, including ourselves, started making mistakes. We started growing our business much before the right economic model and market fit was figured out. We also started diversifying and starting new projects while we still hadn't perfected the first or made it profitable. We started building our team and capabilities for a much larger size of business than what was required with the present scale.Ambition is critical, because that's what motivates us to give our very best every single day - to achieve the undoable. However, a large amount of capital with ambition can be a potent mix that drives a company to defocus from its core. We feel that happened to us. We started doing too many things, and all of us starting with myself and Rohit, are to blame for it.That said, there is almost no successful company on the planet, which hasn't gone through this phase in their lifetime - Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Tesla, Lego, Spicejet, you name it! Each one of them had painted themselves into a corner many times over before they became as wildly successful as they are today. A quick look at their stock prices over the last 15 years will show you what we're talking about. The formula to revive the company is uncannily similar for almost all of them - focus on only your core, stop all non-core activities, reduce costs drastically, turn profitable as soon as you can, and use those profits to spur further growth and new projects. We must do the same, and there is no doubt that with the really smart folks we have in the company, we will make it something that we are all very proud of.This also comes with some tough decisions in the short term. As part of our overall path to profitability plan that is currently in full swing, we will be reorganizing the company into a lean, focused, and entrepreneurial one. We are combining teams, reducing layers, eliminating non-core projects and strengthening the focus on profitable growth. Sadly, we will also be saying really painful goodbyes to some of our colleagues in this process. This is by far the hardest decision that we have ever taken in our lives. Our colleagues are our friends before they are co-workers, and I feel a deep sense of disappointment that we won't be able to have them continue on this journey with us. We will do what we can to help them with their transition to their next opportunity. We take this time to express our sincere gratitude to all those who are leaving us -your contributions have helped build Snapdeal in ways big and small. With time, I am confident, that we will be able to welcome back some of our colleagues who will be leaving us at this point. And that point, we will be a self sufficient, profitable company.Daunting as it may appear in the moment, it is important that we do this now, so that we can continue on our overall mission of building a successful, profitable business that provides incredible opportunities to our customers, sellers and partners. This also means more responsibility for the team members continuing on this journey with us.We believe that every resource of the company should be deployed for driving us towards profitable growth and with this announcement, both Rohit and I are taking a 100% salary cut. Many of our leaders have also stepped up proactively and offered to take a significant cut in their compensation, which is an excellent sign of how galvanised the team feels in this shared quest for profitability.These are tough times, no doubt. But, I am supremely confident, that like we have done before as a team, we will prevail. The greatest companies in the world got built in many interesting patterns - we just can't tell the pattern while are in the midst of it. For now, we need to keep our heads down, focus all our energy on execution that delivers on our two focus areas - best customer and seller experience, and profitable growth. This will mean tough choices and a conscious departure from a me-too race to the edge of the cliff. Let's remember - GMV is vanity, Profit is sanity.I have seen that whenever we put our minds to a well-defined plan, which we believe in unequivocally, we make progress like nobody else can. I am glad that we have picked our path clearly - of building a profitable business over the next two years.",46,"The Snapdeal Founders have written an email to employees explaining the layoffs of around 600 people.

Rafia Qaseem Baig, who joined police force as a constable seven years ago, will work in BDU after completing her 15-day training along with 31 other male members at Nowsheras School of Explosive Handling, media reports said. During her training, she will learn about the types of bombs, their identification and ways to defuse them. Rafia, who belongs to a highly educated family, said a blast near a sessions court seven years ago motivated her to join the force. She completed her masters degree in International Relations. She then pursued another masters degree in Economics and worked at International Rescue Committee where she developed a passion for law and enrolled in an LLB programme that is currently under way. Given her academic qualifications, she was offered jobs in many companies and non-government organisations. However, she chose to join police force in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province when extremists were overtly targeting security forces. After her appointment, she was asked to undergo training sessions in areas including Adezai, Michni and Salman Khel in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. These were the declared red zones at that time. She spent 10 days patrolling these localities with a large number of male police personnel.

3477,"Amid rising cases of violence against doctors, nearly 1,500 resident doctors from New Delhi's AIIMS have decided to learn taekwondo to help defend themselves on duty. Earlier, over 3,000 doctors in Maharashtra had gone on strike for five days over the increasing incidents of violence against doctors. AIIMS doctors had also worn helmets to work in solidarity with their colleagues.","Rising violence against doctors has prompted nearly 1,500 resident doctors from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to learn taekwondo so that they are able to defend themselves on duty. In March, after three incidents of violence were reported in three days, more than 3,000 resident doctors, working in the emergency, out-patient departments and wards, went on strike for five days in Maharashtra. ?We had supported our counterparts in Mumbai by wearing helmets to work in March. This is because we are genuinely concerned about our safety. Keeping the same in mind, we had requested the AIIMS administration to organise self-defence classes for us. They granted us permission to conduct taekwondo classes in AIIMS gymkhana club,? said Dr Vijay Gurjar, president of the resident doctors? association.The doctors, in batches of 100, will train at the gymkhana club between 7-8 pm every day from May 15. The basic course will be for 6 months and the black belt course for 30 months.According to a report in the Lancet journal, while 75% doctors in tertiary care hospitals face physical or verbal violence at work at least once in lifetime, over 40% of them faced it in 2016.The problem is multifactoral. Overcrowding in public health facilities forcing doctors to spend less time with patients, corruption and over-charging for services (in which the referring doctor gets a cut) leading to the breakdown in the doctor-patient trust are some of the reasons recognised by the study.?Doctors are forced to spend less time listening to the patients or their caregivers. The concept of shared decision making is almost absent. The average conversation between a doctor and a patient might last just a few seconds,? said Dr Vijay Nath Mishra, neurology professor, Sir Sunderlal Hospital, Varanasi. VIOLENCE REGISTRYThe IMA will launch a registry where doctors can report any incidence of violence along with evidence such as videos, photos, CCTV footage, and newspaper clippings. The doctors? body will then conduct an investigation and do a root cause analysis.?This will help us in understanding why violence is happening, predict when the violence might happen and look at measures to prevent such incidences,? said Dr Dr KK Agarwal, president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA).WHAT PATIENTS WANT?Confrontations happen because of the anger caused by non-fulfilment of desire. Hence, we need to understand what the patients really want,? said Dr Aggarwal.A survey done by the IMA found that 90% of the patients wanted doctors acknowledge and address them, 92% wanted doctors to listen, 89% wanted the doctors to explain what the illness is and keep them informed throughout. Around 75% of the people also wanted their doctors to review ? ask them if they understood and, if not, help them understand. 40% of the respondents also wanted the doctors to thank them. ?The patients said that they always thank the doctors, but they wanted that the doctor thank them in return as they gave them an opportunity to treat their relative. We called the study ALERT ? Acknowledge, Listen, Explain, Review and Thank,? said Dr Aggarwal.",33,"Amid rising cases of violence against doctors, nearly 1,500 resident doctors from New Delhi's AIIMS have decided to learn taekwondo to help defend themselves on duty.

""Do we have true democracy in the country if all affairs are going to be run according to the wishes of the Prime Minister?"" Thackeray questioned in an interview to the party's mouthpiece Saamana.","swapnil.rawal@hindustantimes.comThe Shiv Sena launched yet another scathing attack on its ally the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) through its mouthpiece Saamana on Sunday. In an interview to the newspaper, party chief Uddhav Thackeray attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused him of ?centralising? power.In a chat with Sena Member of Parliament and executive editor of Saamana Sanjay Raut, Thackeray attacked Modi over his style of functioning, demonetisation, Good and Services Tax (GST) and the PM?s poll pitch ?acche din?. ?The ?acche din? are only limited to government advertisement; the ground reality is completely different. Do we have true democracy in the country if all affairs are going to be run according to the wishes of the Prime Minister? He is centralising power, instead of decentralising it. He is taking away the independence of the states,? Thackeray said.Thackeray, who has been a staunch critic of demonetisation, said the move has not yielded anything positive, instead, it has affected the livelihood of people. ?Around 15 lakh people lost their jobs because of demonetisation. This means around 60 lakh people were directly affected. You should give them jobs now. How are you going to balance ?Start-up India?, ?Make in India? programmes with such colossal job losses? ? Thackeray asked.He also slammed the state government over the farm loan waiver. Thackeray said the government should table the list of 36 lakh farmers, who were going to get the benefit of the waiver in the upcoming Monsoon session. He said the party would continue its ?dhol bajao andolan? (protest by beating drums) to turn the heat on the government over implementing the loan waiver.Interestingly, the Sena chief said he shares a cordial relationship with Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. ?There was no personal animosity between me and the current chief minister. My relation with him is really good. Often, he has accepted the suggestions I have given. He is putting forward views of his party, I am representing the people of the state. The difference is only that,? he said.The two parties share an uncomfortable relationship ever since 2014 Assembly polls where they contested independently. Earlier in 2017, the BJP and the Sena parted ways for the Mumbai civic elections. Sena, which is the junior partner in the central and state governments, has never missed an opportunity to speak up against the BJP and the prime minister. Reiterating his stand, Thackeray said he and his party will continue to speak up whenever they disagree with the decision of the BJP in the state and at the Centre. ?I want to explain my stand here. Whenever I say something or Sena speaks, we are considered anti-government. I am not anti-government. I am merely on the side of the people,? he said.",40,"Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for 'centralising power' and taking away the independence of the states.

225,Delhi civic bodies reportedly plan to make the acts of littering in public places and allowing mosquito breeding in households criminal offences with appropriate jail terms. The imprisonment will vary from one month to six months depending on the severity of the violation. This comes after Municipal Corporation officials said existing penalties were too weak to deter violators. ,"Trash the city and you may end up behind bars.To deter litterbugs, Delhi's BJP-ruled civic bodies are planning to make discarding of waste in public places and even allowing mosquito breeding in households a criminal offence with appropriate jail terms under the Indian Penal Code.The East Delhi Municipal Corporation has already issued orders in this regard and the two other agencies will follow suit, officials said. Municipal magistrates will keep a check on violators and ensure they are prosecuted. A person can get a maximum jail term of six months for such an offence.The Narendra Modi government last year directed states to start levying fines for littering, open defecation and public urination as the Prime Minister's flagship Swachh Bharat Mission failed to have the desired effect in urban areas. 'EXISTING PENALTY TOO WEAK'According to MCD officials, the existing penalty on violating sanitation bylaws is too weak to deter people and so it was decided to slap criminal charges on them. The imprisonment would vary from one month to six months depending on severity of the violation.""To keep Delhi free of littering and insanitary conditions, various provisions of IPC and the Delhi Municipal Corporation (DMC) Act may be invoked against the violators...departments may proceed accordingly,"" said an order issued by the chief law officer of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation.Public spaces in the Capital often are eyesores full of rotting piles of garbage along the streets, in neighbourhoods, public parks and playgrounds, and outside fancy air-conditioned malls and five-star hotels. HIGH COURT INSTRUCTIONSThe move from the corporations follows instructions of the Delhi High Court to maintain proper sanitation in the city. The court had recently pulled up the three civic bodies and had said that even citizens should take the responsibility of keeping their surroundings clean. The HC directed that a time-bound garbage collection system be set up to prevent the piling of waste. A senior MCD official said mosquito breeding in households is a key concern of the civic body as this could result into the outbreak of vectorborne diseases like dengue and chikungunya. ""Cases of dengue in recent years have been on the rise, claiming several lives. The occupants of a house where dengue larva is found may be booked for endangering public life and causing health hazards. The provision attracts a fine and imprisonment of up to six months,"" he said. Similarly, negligence by people that is likely to spread fatal diseases would also be dealt with strictly. The civic body has identified 14 provisions under IPC to deal with sanitation woes. Any pollution that may cause fouling of drinking water has also been put in the category of criminal offences. 'FAILED ATTEMPTS' Officials said repeated attempts by the MCDs to amend the sanitation bylaws for higher penalty have failed to yield results. The draft of the amendment is pending with the Delhi government for the last seven years. The modified rules would have provision for hefty penalties up to Rs 10,000 and five times higher for repeated offenders. Apart from the fine, the civic bodies have also proposed widening the ambit of the law. Littering caused by distributing food material (langar), illegal burning of solid waste, improper storage of construction material and non-segregation of recyclable and nonrecyclable waste will attract fines. These activities were till now undefined and so exempted from prosecution. The MCDs proposed to increase the fine for littering caused by langars to Rs 5,000, while penalty for dumping construction material on roadside was fixed at Rs 10,000. The proposed amendment prescribed a fine of Rs 500 for littering, spitting and urinating in public places. It also empowers the municipal magistrates to order community services, like road cleaning, garbage and graffiti removal, in case a person fails to pay the fine. The amendment in ""Delhi Sanitation and Public Health Bylaws"" was proposed by the erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) on June 23, 2010 and the civic body had adopted it through a resolution passed by the House.",30,Delhi civic bodies reportedly plan to make the acts of littering in public places and allowing mosquito breeding in households criminal offences with appropriate jail terms.

Hale, who joined the Supreme Court in 2009, will earn £225,000 a year as the President. She had earlier served as a counsel to Queen Elizabeth.","Brenda Hale has been appointed as the first female president of the UK supreme court.Lady Hale is a longstanding champion of diversity in the judiciary. She has previously said the court should be ashamed if it does not improve its record on the issue. Her appointment was announced on Friday and she will take up the role on 2 October, when she will be sworn in as president. She said: ?It is a great honour and a challenge to be appointed to succeed Lord Neuberger. I look forward to building upon his pioneering achievements, including developing closer links with each part of the United Kingdom, for example by sitting outside London, and improving the ways in which we communicate our work to the public. ?Recent high-profile cases mean that more people than ever before have heard of the supreme court, and we hope that this will help to create a broader understanding of how the judiciary serves society.?Hale?s appointment was announced alongside that of Jill Black, who, after promotion from the court of appeal, becomes the second female justice in the UK?s highest court. Two other court of appeal judges, David Lloyd Jones and Michael Briggs, were also appointed to the supreme court on Friday.A family law expert, Hale joined the supreme court in 2009 and is among the last of the judges who can serve to 75 as she became a judge before rules were changed in 1995 to make retiring at 70 mandatory.She will earn £225,000 a year as the head of the court. Neuberger said: ?I have had the pleasure of working closely with Lady Hale over the last five years, and have seen at first hand the intellect and humanity with which she approaches the appeals which come before her, as well as her commitment to the rule of law, legal education and building public understanding of the work of the courts.?For Lady Hale to become president of the institution to which she has contributed so much is a fitting pinnacle to a truly ground-breaking career.?Hale has criticised the inbuilt bias in choosing judges, and the dependence on ?soundings? from judges, as producing a judiciary that is ?not only mainly male, overwhelmingly white, but also largely the product of a limited range of educational institutions and social backgrounds?.Born in Yorkshire in 1945, she went to a state school, Richmond high school for girls, and then to Girton College, Cambridge, where she read law and graduated top of her class.Hale?s career began in academia when she joined the University of Manchester law faculty as a junior lecturer. While teaching ? and working in a pub ? she studied for the bar exams, winning the top results for her year in the bar finals. She was also the first woman and youngest person to be appointed to the Law Commission.In 1989, she was appointed Queen?s counsel and in 1994 she became a high court judge, the first to have made her career as an academic and public servant rather than as a practising barrister.In 1999, she became the second woman to be appointed to the court of appeal; Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss was the first. Hale also became the first female law lord. In June 2013, she was appointed deputy president of the supreme court.Like Hale, Black is a family law specialist ? although she initially took on a broad range of criminal and civil work at the bar ? and worked in academia, having taught at then Leeds Polytechnic in the 1980s. She was raised in north Wales and studied at Durham University. Earlier this year, the 63-year-old was on a panel of appeal court judges who ruled against the government following freedom of information requests to view a former minister?s diaries. Lloyd Jones, 65, who grew up in Pontypridd, south Wales, was a ?friend of the court?, offering legal advice in the hearings into whether former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet had sovereign immunity from arrest and potential extradition to Spain over alleged human rights crimes.Briggs, 62, grew up in a naval family, following his father between ships on the south coast.

446,Singers of the hit song Despacito have slammed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro after his government used a remixed version of the song to encourage Venezuelans to vote for setting up a body to rewrite the Constitution. The singers said they were neither asked nor did they authorise the use or the change in lyrics of the song for political ambitions.,"Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro?s attempt to use Latin hit Despacito - which means ?slowly? ? to inject some cool into his controversial new congress has backfired quickly. Maduro?s unpopular leftist government on Sunday promoted a remixed version of Despacito to encourage Venezuelans to vote for the Constituent Assembly, which will have powers to rewrite the national charter and supersede other institutions. ?Our call to the Constituent Assembly only seeks to unite the country ... Despacito!? goes the Socialist Party-sanctioned remix of the catchy dance song, which was played during Maduro?s weekly televised show. ?What do you think, eh? Is this video approved?? a grinning and clapping Maduro called out to the crowd, which roared back in approval. But Puerto Rican singers Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee on Monday said they do not approve at all.?At no point was I asked, nor did I authorize, the use or the change in lyrics of Despacito for political ambitions, and much less in the middle of a deplorable situation that Venezuela, a country I love so much, is living,? Fonsi said in a message posted on Twitter. Daddy Yankee, meanwhile, posted a picture of Maduro with a big red cross over it on Instagram. ?That you illegally appropriate a song (Despacito) does not compare with the crimes you commit and have committed in Venezuela. Your dictatorial regime is a joke, not only for my Venezuelan brothers, but for the entire world,? he said. ?With this nefarious marketing plan, you only highlight your fascist ideal.? Millions of Venezuelans have been staging months of protests against Maduro, a former bus driver and union leader narrowly elected to replace the late Hugo Chavez in 2013. Some 100 people have died in the unrest, which has further hammered an imploding economy that is running short of food and medicine.

It combines new measures targeting Russia for its interference in the 2016 election, as well as provisions intended to curb North Korea?s nuclear weapons program and Iranian militarism.Only three libertarian-leaning Republicans ? Justin Amash of Michigan, Tom Massie of Kentucky and Jimmy Duncan of Tennessee ? voted against the bill in the House.The bill had been bogged down in controversy in recent weeks over objections from the Trump administration. The White House has been opposed to a provision in the bill that requires congressional approval for any attempt by the president to lift the sanctions on Russia.An earlier Senate version of the bill passed 98-2, but was only aimed at Russia and Iran. It did not include the measures against North Korea, which are now in the House bill. The latest bill must now return to the Senate, where it is expected to pass easily, before it is sent to Trump.Despite the White House?s opposition to the bill, it is likely to become law.

But decades later, filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani has decided to bring Sanju baba's life on 70mm. And if reports are to be believed, Madhuri's existence in his life has been carefully cropped in the biopic. There were rumours a few months ago that Dhak Dhak girl had requested Hirani to chop off her part. However, in an interview to Mid-Day, Madhuri rubbished the rumours and said, ""For where I am today, this [the topic of Dutt] has become redundant. Life has come a long way since then.

101,"A swarm of bees reportedly attacked a Hyderabad-Pune flight last week and delayed it by almost an hour. The flight was able to take off only after a repellent spray was used to clear the insects from the area. ""We will look into the matter and necessary action will be taken,"" a Directorate General of Civil Aviation official said. ","After a swarm of bees held up a Hyderabad-Pune flight last week for more than one hour, the country aviation regulator said it will investigate how a bee hive was allowed to flourish in the airport area. The flight on July 26 was held up when the ATR?72 - a short-haul aircraft - was besieged by bees. The flight, which was scheduled to take off at around 6.25pm, took off only at around 7.22pm after a repellent spray was used to clear the insects from the apron area. This was the first such incident in the past five years.  A Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) official on Monday said, ?We will look into the matter and necessary action will be taken.? Air India spokesperson, Dhananjay Kumar, confirmed the incident and said that taking safety as priority, the pilot took necessary precautions before taking off the flight. ?The swarms of bees kept coming and settling on the wind screen of the cockpit, not allowing the pilot to push back,? he explained.The incident took place when the flight was to line up for its scheduled take off. The Flight 9I 867 of Alliance Air, a subsidiary of Air India, couldn?t push back when a group of bees surrounded the twin engine turboprop. Though the aircraft?s door was shut to stop bees from entering it, the pilot got in touch with the Air Traffic Control (ATC) who in turn informed the airport operator. The pilot had to then call for a spray in order to get rid of the bees. Commenting on the incident, Captain Mohan Ranganathan, aviation safety expert, said, ?Bees do not pose a threat to the ATR but the engineers and other ground staff who play a major role before take-off would  have found it impossible to perform their functions due to their presence.? Pilots said that the bee hives shouldn?t be in the airport premises as part of the air safety measures taken in the airport. Former Indian Air Force helicopter pilot and aviation expert, Vipul Saxena, said that the delay will not only be with respect to the safety of the passengers but also for the safety of the cockpit crew.?The DGCA should take a note of the incident and ensure that they do not occur again,? said a senior pilot associated with a leading airline.

461,"Dozens of teen pregnancy prevention programs deemed ineffective by US President Donald Trump's administration will lose over $200 million in funding following a surprise decision to end five-year grants after only three years. US government officials said only four of 37 programs studied showed lasting positive impacts. Critics urged the government ""not to turn back the clock"" on progress.","Dozens of teen pregnancy prevention programs deemed ineffective by President Donald Trump?s administration will lose more than $200 million in funding following a surprise decision to end five-year grants after only three years.The administration?s assessment is in sharp contrast with that of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which credited the program with contributing to an all-time low rate of teen pregnancies.Rachel Fey of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy said Tuesday that grantees under the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program were given no explanation when notified this month their awards will end next June. The program, begun under President Barack Obama?s administration, receives about $100 million a year.?We know so little about the rationale behind cutting short these grants,? said Fey, who said the teen birth rate has fallen by about 40 percent nationally since the program went into effect in 2010. The focus of the program is on evidence-based interventions aimed at preventing teen pregnancy. It does not pay for or provide contraceptives.A Health and Human Services spokesman said late Tuesday that an evaluation of the first round of grants released last fall found only four of 37 programs studied showed lasting positive impacts. Most of the other programs had no effect or were harmful, the department said, including three that it said increased the likelihood that teens would have unprotected sex and become pregnant.?Given the very weak evidence of positive impact of these programs, the Trump administration, in its ... 2018 budget proposal, did not recommend continued funding for the TPP program,? the department statement said.The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists urged the administration ?not to turn back the clock? on progress.?It?s as though the evidence and the facts don?t matter,? ACOG President Dr. Haywood Brown said.The North Texas Alliance to Reduce Unintended Pregnancy in Teens, one of more than 80 current grantees around the country, will lose just under $1 million a year, about three-quarters of its budget, Executive Director Terry Goltz Greenberg said. The program worked with more than 1,700 kids last year in high-poverty neighborhoods where the teen birth rates are three to five times the national average, she said.?Most of the evidence-based programs are not just talking about contraception but are putting it in the context of bigger goals in life, such as, ?Where do you want to be in three years?? ?How does a kid fit into that,?? she said.Elizabeth Gomez, 44, said the Texas program?s after-school classes taught her how to discuss difficult topics with her three daughters in a respectful way that made them listen and respond.?For Hispanics, it?s difficult, because it?s a taboo to talk about sex,? she said.A letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price signed by 37 Democratic senators called the decision short-sighted. Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program grantees served a half-million youth from 2010 to 2014 and were on their way to serve an additional 1.2 million through 2019 when the grant was scheduled to end, the senators said. Their letter asked Price for an explanation and questioned the timing of the notifications in advance of congressional action on fiscal year 2018 appropriations.Two of Shawanda Brown-Cannon?s children take classes once a week through a southwest Georgia program called Quest for Change which, according to its director, will lose about 87 percent of its total budget.The classes prompted both her 17-year-old daughter, Amaya, and her 13-year-old son, Chandler, to talk with their mother about what they?ve learned, for instance a Valentine?s Day class on how to show love without sexual activity.?It opens up a line of communication,? Brown-Cannon said.Angelina Jackson, a 17-year-old high school senior, is a member of Quest for Change. She helps run classroom lessons and organize events as a member of the youth leadership council focused on her school.?Some people are not able to talk to their parents at home about the stuff that Quest does,? Jackson said. ?They provided a comfortable environment where people could ask questions or talk about their concerns.?Vermont-based Youth Catalytics was informed July 5 that its five-year, $2.8 million federal grant had been cut off June 30, the end of the first year. The grant provided about half of the organization?s annual budget. As recently as July 3, people from the organization had been working with HHS officials about the details of the program, said Meagan Downey, the group?s director of special projects. The grant covered about half of her salary.Downey said her organization was one of five grant recipients nationwide that lost their funding immediately. Others were given until July 1, 2018 to prepare for the loss of the funds.Leaders of the HOPE Buffalo program always had an eye toward establishing partnerships with city and community leaders that would enable its work to continue beyond the five-year lifespan of the grant, which provided $2 million a year, Project Director Stan Martin said. With less time and less funding, he said, ?our efforts were just accelerated.?",47,"Dozens of teen pregnancy prevention programs deemed ineffective by US President Donald Trump's administration will lose over $200 million in funding following a surprise decision to end five-year grants after only three years.

Joe Howlett had saved roughly two dozen whales in fifteen years, after they became tangled in fishing nets. The fisheries department said, ""taking part in whale rescue operations requires immense bravery and a passion for the welfare of marine mammals.""","A Canadian lobster fisherman who saved dozens of endangered whales after they became tangled in fishing nets has been killed ? moments after a last successful rescue.Joe Howlett, from Campobello Island, New Brunswick, boarded a vessel off the province?s eastern coast on Monday to help rescue a north Atlantic right whale that had become heavily tangled in rope. The rescue was steeped in urgency: in the past month, seven north Atlantic right whales have been found floating lifelessly in the Gulf of St Lawrence, off Canada. With a global population believed to be around 525, the string of deaths suggests that more than 1% of the population has died in recent weeks. Howlett helped free the whale ? only to be struck by the mammal moments later, said Mackie Green of the Campobello Whale Rescue Team. ?They got the whale totally disentangled and then some kind of freak thing happened and the whale made a big flip,? Green, who was not onboard the vessel, told the Canadian Press.Howlett had previously saved some two dozen whales over the past 15 years, making use of his deep knowledge of knots and ropes to set the huge mammals free. Just a few days before his death, Howlett had helped liberate another north Atlantic right whale in the region, cutting away a fishing line caught in its mouth. ?Joe definitely would not want us to stop because of this,? said Green, who joined forces with Howlett to launch the whale rescue in 2002. ?This is something he loved and there?s no better feeling than getting a whale untangled, and I know how good he was feeling after cutting that whale clear.?On Tuesday, the federal fisheries department confirmed that Howlett had been killed while on one of its vessels, describing him as an ?irreplaceable member of the whale rescue community?.In a statement, the department offered its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of the father of two. ?Taking part in whale rescue operations requires immense bravery and a passion for the welfare of marine mammals,? it noted. ?There are serious risks involved with any disentanglement attempt. Each situation is unique, and entangled whales can be unpredictable.?Howlett?s death comes amid the unprecedented loss of seven north Atlantic right whales in the past month. A team included marine biologists, federal scientists and pathologists, among others, have been racing to figure out why the whales ? which live along the eastern seaboard of Canada and the US and can reach up to 16 metres (50ft) in length ? are dying in large numbers. Last week, they carried out necropsies on three of the seven whales, hoping to find clues before the carcasses decompose. While their findings are still preliminary and don?t explain why the deaths have seemingly occurred within such a short time frame, they found signs of severe blunt trauma and bruising on two of the whales, suggesting collision with a vessel, while the third had been tangled in fishing gear for weeks.",26,"A Canadian lobster fisherman died after getting struck by a North Atlantic right whale, moments after rescuing it on Monday.

A BMC report revealed that over 62 lakh houses were checked for mosquito breeding and ?20 lakh was collected as fine from residents for not adhering to safety standards. ","The insecticide department of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) visited around 62 lakh houses and found more than 10,000 mosquito breeding spots in 8,744 of them over the past six months. Officials said they collected Rs20 lakh in fine from residents who failed to eliminate mosquito breeding spots in their homes. Rajan Naringrekar, insecticide officer, BMC, said the civic body focussed its efforts on finding breeding grounds of dengue carrier Aedes aegypti and malaria carrier Anopheles stephensi. From January 1 to July 15, 10, 260 breeding spots were found, of which 7,586 had larvae of Aedes aegypti and 2,674 had those of Anopheles stephensi . ?The issue is serious because a single female mosquito lays around 100-150 eggs at a time.

Naringrekar added. Data from the past two years suggested that 80% of dengue patients had breeding spots in or around their homes.Naringrekar  said since mosquitoes only breed in fresh water, people can control the spread of the disease right from their own homes. ?We have been advising residents to clean ornamental trees, feng-shui plants, bamboo plants, money plants, plates, pots, refrigerators and air-conditioners regularly to avoid dengue infection.

This comes after Trump's new Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci slammed Priebus as a ""fu**ing paranoid schizophrenic"". Priebus has reportedly claimed that he resigned privately on Thursday.","Donald Trump has forced out Reince Priebus as the White House chief of staff and replaced him with the homeland security secretary, Gen John Kelly.Trump tweeted: ?I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House chief of staff. He is a great American ? and a great leader. John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security. He has been a true star of my administration.?The departure of Priebus came as little surprise after he was the subject of a furious, foul-mouthed attack by new communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who claimed he would be asked to quit imminently. Priebus told the Wall Street Journal in a text message that he resigned privately on Thursday.Trump ? who in six months has now lost a chief of staff, deputy chief of staff, national security adviser, communications director and press secretary ? added on Twitter: ?I would like to thank Reince Priebus for his service and dedication to his country. We accomplished a lot together and I am proud of him!?According to a pooled report, Trump sent the tweets shortly after Air Force One landed back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, following a trip to Long Island, New York. Priebus and Scaramucci were also on the flight.In a statement, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said: ?General John Kelly is one of the true stars of the administration. He has helped seal the border and reduced illegal immigration by 70%. He is respected by everyone, especially the people at the Department of Homeland Security.?The entire administration loves him and no one is comparable. He will begin on Monday morning and a cabinet meeting will follow his swearing in Monday morning.?She added: ?The president thanks Reince Priebus for his service. They accomplished a lot together. He was loyal in his dedication to the president. The president thanks him and his family for his great service to the country, and he will always be a member of the Trump team.?Sanders then spoke to reporters outside her office. Asked if the decision was Priebus?s or Trump?s, she replied: ?We all serve at the pleasure of the president. The conversations about this started with the president and Reince about two weeks ago, in terms of timing.?She denied that the change had anything do with Scaramucci, and said Trump and Kelly had been ?talking about it for a while?.On Friday, Priebus said in a statement: ?It has been one of the greatest honours of my life to serve this president and our country. I want to thank the president for giving me this very special opportunity. I will continue to serve as a strong supporter of the president?s agenda and policies. I can?t think of a better person than John Kelly to succeed me and I wish him God?s blessings and great success.?In an interview with CNN just two hours after his departure was announced, Priebus paid homage to Trump. ?I am going to honor the president every day,? he said, adding: ?I?m always going to be a Trump fan. I?m on Team Trump.? He refused to respond to Scaramucci?s comments, saying: ?I?m not going to get into the mud.?While Priebus insisted he had resigned, there were strong hints that there was more under the surface. He said on CNN that the president had wanted to ?hit the reset button? and ?intuitively determined that it was time to do something differently?.On Friday, House speaker Paul Ryan, a close Priebus ally who has had a tense relationship with Trump, said: ?Reince Priebus has left it all out on the field, for our party and our country. Here is a guy from Kenosha, Wisconsin, who revitalized the Republican national committee and became White House chief of staff. He has served the president and the American people capably and passionately. He has achieved so much, and he has done it all with class. I could not be more proud to call Reince a dear friend.?He added: ?I congratulate Secretary Kelly on his appointment, and look forward to working with him to advance our agenda.?Priebus was one of the least powerful chiefs of staff in recent history, and his future had long been a matter of speculation. In a highly unorthodox move, Trump decided that Priebus and chief strategist Steve Bannon would serve as ?equal partners? in implementing his agenda.The gossip intensified rapidly a week ago, when Scaramucci was appointed as communications director despite Priebus?s objections. The former Wall Street banker claimed they were ?like brothers? but tensions soon flared.Scaramucci clearly suspected Priebus of leaking information to the media. This led him to call the New Yorker and give an interview in which he described Priebus as ?a fucking paranoid schizophrenic? who would soon be asked to resign.On Tuesday, Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that no staff shakeup was in the cards. But according to media reports, he privately floated potential replacements including Kelly, deputy national security adviser Dina Powell, chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and former campaign adviser David Urban.In an interview earlier this week, Michael Steele, predecessor of Priebus as chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), said: ?It?s very clear the president has very little confidence in him. Reince?s head is on the block, as was Sean Spicer?s. Sean just got up and removed himself before the axe came down.?Priebus is the latest casualty in Trump?s West Wing. Others include national security adviser Michael Flynn, former deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, press secretary Sean Spicer and press aide Michael Short.Priebus went out of his way to appease Trump?s insurgent candidacy during the 2016 election campaign. After Trump?s victory in the Indiana primary and Ted Cruz?s decision to drop out, Priebus declared Trump the presumptive nominee, though Ohio governor John Kasich was still in the race, and then used the full muscle of the RNC to quash efforts to deny Trump the Republican nomination at the party convention in Cleveland.He also went in person to Trump Tower in 2015 for Trump to sign a loyalty oath to the Republican party, a deeply unusual step for an RNC chair to court such a recalcitrant candidate.Kelly, meanwhile, has been arguably Trump?s favourite cabinet secretary and is leading efforts to build a wall on the Mexican border. Kelly ran the US southern command, which includes the military prison at Guantánamo Bay. In 2010, his son, Lt Robert Michael Kelly, was killed after stepping on a landmine in Afghanistan.In a Memorial Day speech at Arlington national cemetery earlier this year, Trump said: ?I especially want to extend our gratitude to Secretary John Kelly for joining us today. Incredible man. I always like to call him General. He understands more than most ever could or ever will the wounds and burdens of war.?Kelly said in a statement he was honoured to be asked to serve as chief of staff, adding praise for the staff of the homeland security department: ?When I left the Marines, I never thought I would find as committed, as professional, as patriotic a group of individuals. I was wrong. You accomplish great things every day defending our nation and I know your exceptional work will continue.?Kelly?s appointment leaves a gap at the Department of Homeland Security. Claire McCaskill, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee, said: ?General Kelly has a long history of service to our country and I had a good working relationship with him as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. With the threats facing this nation, I urge the president to nominate a qualified secretary to replace General Kelly as quickly as possible.?In a week of exceptional turmoil, Trump has also turned his ire on Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, accusing him of weakness for recusing himself from the investigation into the Trump campaign?s alleged collusion with Russia.",79,"US President Donald Trump has forced out his White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and named the Homeland Security Secretary, General John Kelly, as the replacement.

The aim is to promote tourism, reduce travel time between the two points from 3.5 hours to 45 minutes and keep burden off the roads. ""Yamuna upstream... has the 'required depth' for navigation,"" said an official.","Delhi may join the elite club of cities with water taxi services by June end as the Centre?s Yamuna Water Taxi project to ferry tourists and public from Palla (Delhi-Haryana border) to Wazirabad is moving as per schedule.The service aims to promote tourism and reduce travel time between Wazirabad and Fatehpur Jat to 45 minutes. The distance between two points is nearly 20 kilomertres but due to poor public transport connectivity and heavy traffic movement  on the stretch (it connects the national capital to Haryana) , it takes 3.5 hours to cover the distance. Initially, only three of the five boarding points will open. The Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has been appointed to implement the project and the process to procure vessels and develop infrastructure is already underway. The authority has moved a plea seeking environmental clearance from the National Green Tribunal (NGT).Amitabh Verma, chairman of IWAI, said as no permanent structure will be constructed, the authority hopes it will get a nod from the environment watchdog.  ?Things are very much on the track. Tenders for dredging, three passenger vessels, and jetties have been floated. Hopefully, by the end of June, we will start the ferry service in the city,? he said.The decision came after a feasibility study was done to identify a suitable stretch of the river for navigation and development of water transport facilities. After this, Delhi water minister Kapil Mishra along with the officials of IWAI, irrigation and flood control department and Delhi Jal Board (DJB), conducted a site inspection in July 2016. Experts disapproveEnvironmentalists are not amused with the idea and said the river does not have enough water round the year to survive such activities on a large scale. Manoj Misra, convenor of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan, said the water available on the stretch is meant to be used for drinking purposes and this arrangement should not be disturbed. ?This will affect the biodiversity along the river. If one wants to use small-hand rowing boats for leisure, it makes sense but water taxis will be useless,? he said.Environmentalist Vikram Soni, a professor at Centre for Theoretical Physics, Jamia Millia Islamia, said the plan does not seem feasible because the river does not have enough water except for the three months during monsoon. ?This will lead to destruction of the flood plain. They should not touch it but make efforts to save it for future generations,? he said.Authorities optimisticAfter the feasibility study, it was found that the stretch is suitable for the implementation of one of the priority projects of road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari. ?Yamuna upstream, which is almost 22 kms from Wazirabad to Palla, is less polluted and has the ?required depth? for navigation. The study said that water taxi and recreation activities are the most feasible and environmentally sustainable for this stretch. The initiative will help keep burden off the roads to some extent,? added Verma.If the plan is implemented successfully, the authorities are optimistic that it will pave the way for introduction of more water recreational activities or sports in Delhi and the Centre?s ambitious Delhi-Agra steamer service through Agra Canal project. ?Water sports are quite common and popular abroad. This will not only help boost tourism but also facilitate to rejuvenate the river by sensitising the youth about the importance of the river,? he said.",33,"The Centre's Yamuna Water Taxi Services, which would ferry tourists from Palla at Delhi-Haryana border to Wazirabad, may start operations by June this year.

Owaisi said that like the Tamils, Muslims also have their own culture and they should derive inspiration from the Tamil protests which he said made even Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bow down. Owaisi added that nobody should interfere with their customs of marriage and triple talaq.""In Tamil Nadu, people protested in lakhs to fight for their tradition. Modi had to bow in front of them. Are we any less than them? We also have our own culture. We will marry and divorce the way we want to. Nobody should direct us what we should do,"" Owaisi said. Owaisi's statement has come at a time when the Supreme Court is looking into the constitutional validity of triple talaq after several women's groups challenged the practice.WHY THE CONTROVERSYWhile the Allahabad High Court termed triple talaq unconstitutional in December, 2016, the Supreme Court is separately hearing another plea filed by Saira Bano who has challenged the three rules related to Niqah (wedding). These rules are: Talaq-e-Bidat, Niqah Halala and a man's right to have four wives.TALAQ-E-BIDATTalaq-e-Bidat is the practice which gives a man the right to divorce to his wife by uttering 'talaq' three times without waiting for her consent on the matter.In the Islamic tradition, some conditions were imposed for Talaq-e-Bidat. A man can divorce his wife by uttering 'talaq' three times during the period of a Tuhar, that is, the time period of two menstruation cycles.This could be done in one sitting or spread over the specified period. Under Talaq-e-Bidat, the wife's consent is not required for the separation.NIQAH HALALAThere have been instances where men have uttered 'talaq' three times in an inebriated state or in a fit of rage and have later wanted to revert to normal married life. However, the practice of Niqah Halala prevents the reversal of the triple talaq.According to the practice of Niqah Halala, a man is not allowed to marry the same woman after divorce even if both the partners are willing. Such a niqah is considered haraam (illegal).Niqah Halala requires that the divorced woman marry some other man and after obtaining divorce from her second husband, she can remarry her first husband the second time.WATCH: Owaisi urges Muslims to fight for triple talaq the way Tamils fought for jallikattu",23,"All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) Chief Asaduddin Owaisi has urged Muslims to stand in support of triple talaq just like the people of Tamil Nadu stood against the ban on traditional bull-taming sport Jallikattu.

Things did not work out but soon news emerged that Vishal Bhardwaj was making a similar film for UTV.UTV and Vishal Bhardwaj told Roy Wadia that their film, then-titled Julia, was not inspired by the story of Fearless Nadia. Later, Wadia learned that the film was shelved. In 2008, Wadia signed an agreement with a German firm that it could use all of Wadias' copyrighted material on Fearless Nadia to make a film on her.Seven years later, Roy Wadia got news that a film called Rangoon was being made and that it was supposedly based around Nadia's life. Wadia told the film's makers that the rights to Fearless Nadia's character and story were with a German firm and if Vishal and co. still went ahead with Rangoon, they could land in legal trouble. Disney UTV (then, headed by Siddharth Roy Kapur) assured Wadia and the German firm that the film wouldn't be made.Then in 2016, while Vishal was making Rangoon with Sajid Nadiadwala, Vishal assured Roy Wadia that his film was a love story set in the backdrop of World War II and was not remotely inspired by Nadia's life. UTV Disney by then was not in the picture.When Wadia finally saw the film's promos in 2017, he realised that Kangana's character Julia was indeed inspired from the life of Fearless Nadia.Watch Rangoon trailer here:Now, the suit comes up for hearing in Mumbai High Court on February 20.While the Rangoon camp has been quiet about this since the matter is sub-judice, a member from Rangoon's cast, requesting anonymity said, ""Kangana was advised to watch Hunterwali (a famous 1935 Fearless Nadia stunt film), and the stylists told to reference her dressing for Kangana, who plays Julia.

Speaking at the Word To Screen, Publishers Bootcamp by Jio MAMI here, Guild president Siddharth Roy Kapur said that ?making a biopic on a political figure is radioactive right now?.Later, prodded by IANS to elaborate on the sidelines of the event, Kapur said, ?It?s unfortunately the environment that we are in at this point of time that most filmmakers are self-censoring when it comes to subjects that they pick to make a movie about because they are concerned about how it will finally be received when it goes to the CBFC for clearance. In that process, we might be really losing out on quite a few interesting stories that should be told, and I do hope that the environment changes.?Movies like Lipstick Under My Burkha and Udta Punjab ran foul of the censor board but were cleared after appeals or cuts.Kapur, former head honcho of Studios, Disney UTV, said that former actress Smriti Irani?s appointment as Cabinet Minister for Information and Broadcasting, would bring about a change for the Indian film industry which was constantly battling censorship woes. ?It?s a very positive step because she?s someone who understands the industry. I?m quite certain that we will see an easy and a more liberal view of film certification in the months to come,? Kapur said.?I believe that the (government-appointed) Shyam Benegal Committee has made some very good recommendations on what should be done as far as the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) is concerned. I do hope that?s implemented at the earliest,? added Kapur.Given that the $2 billion film industry of India, one of the largest movie-producing nations in the world, was not generating the moolah it should for a multiple of reasons -- lack of screens, slowdown in domestic theatrical revenue, steady growth in Hollywood market share and emergence of digital platforms and quality content -- Kapur sees light at the end of the tunnel.?Every industry goes through cyclical times. The cycle we are going through right now is where the economics are very challenging. Having said that, I?m quite optimistic that since we have a very strong movie-going culture, our own ethos of a star system and our own grammar of storytelling, we will come out of this,? said Kapur.?I think it?s about the industry figuring out an economic model that makes sense to everyone in the value chain rather than for a few people. And once that changes, we will see the industry do much better,? he said, adding how filmmakers need to be ?smart about their films?, release date and strategy.As for Hollywood eating into local films? business, he said, ?It?s happening and it?s definitely something to be concerned about... Because the fact is that they are making movies that are bringing people to cinemas... And that?s what we need to do too.?Exorbitant fee charged by stars can sometimes inflate a film?s budget, but breaking away from the strongly-rooted star system is going to be no answer either, said Kapur. ?I don?t think the star system will break and I don?t think it should. But I think that along with the star system, there needs to be great content that can stand on its own without any star. I have seen so many movies in the recent past that have done this and have done it very effectively,? he said.Kapur has been associated -- as producer, co-producer or associate producer -- with a mix of these -- Dangal, Kai Po Che, The Lunchbox, Raajneeti, Barfi!, Chennai Express, Shahid, Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana, A Wednesday and Paan Singh Tomar.

He was leaving from his shot and I was going to enter. I just saw him walking pass by me I went up to him and told him ?Hi Salman sir I am Taapsee Pannu? and he said ?Hi?.

Off camera, Taapsee revealed the Sultan star often cracked jokes and shared anecdotes of his Judwaa days. ?When we were in the room Salman had some really funny moments to share about his experience of Judwaa. We three including me, Jacqueline and Varun were just listening. With the life and career that he has, he has some interesting anecdotes to share I hope I get to hear more of that.?After intense drama films like Pink, Naam Shabana, Judwaa 2 is a welcome change for Taapsee. ?For the last six months I am dancing, getting ready, having fun, big sets, big director, producer, feeling like a Bollywood heroine. I am in Bollywood diva zone. I was enjoying the fruits of my hardwork for these six months.

The move would allow anyone with Rs 5 in hand to access washrooms in even five-star hotels of South Delhi.According to an SDMC official, the decision has been taken on the advice of lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to explore the possibility of making toilets in restaurants and hotels open to public use.?We want the hotels and restaurants to adhere to the decision in full spirit rather than wait for the SDMC to enforce it,? said SDMC commissioner Puneet Goel.?The hotels and restaurants will also need to put up display boards informing the public about the facilities.

Islamabad had sought the court's intervention over the shooting down of its naval aircraft by the Indian Air Force in 1999. A 16-judge bench voted 14-2 to dismiss Pakistan's case.","The International Court of Justice (ICJ) was last a battleground for India and Pakistan nearly 18 years ago when Islamabad sought its intervention over the shooting down of its naval aircraft.Tomorrow, the ICJ, which is the U.N.'s principal judicial organ, is holding a public hearing at the Great Hall of Justice housed in the Peace Palace at The Hague in Netherlands where the two countries will be asked to present their case over the contentious Jadhav issue.India on May 8 moved a petition before the U.N. body to seek justice for Kulbhushan Jadhav, 46, alleging violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations by Pakistan after its 16 requests for consular access to the former naval officer was consistently denied.A Pakistani military court awarded death sentence to Jadhav last month for alleged espionage and subversive activities. Pakistan has also not responded to the request for visas applied by Jadhav's family. Jadhav was arrested on March 3 last year.PREVIOUS CASE FOUGHTThe previous case was related to shooting down of Pakistan's maritime reconnaissance aircraft Atlantique by the Indian Air Force (IAF) in the Kutch region on August 10, 1999, killing all 16 naval personnel on board. Pakistan claimed the plane was brought down in its air space and sought 60 million USD in damages from India for the incident.A 16-judge bench of the court on June 21, 2000 voted 14-2 to dismiss Pakistan's claim. The decision was announced by bench president Gilbert Guillaume of France at a public sitting. The verdict was final and there was no appeal.The ICJ found that it has no jurisdiction to entertain the application filed by Pakistan on September 21, 1999.Public hearings in the case titled 'Aerial incident of August 10, 1999 (Pakistan vs India)' lasted four days ending April 6, 2000. Arguments centred on the court's jurisdiction in the case which had to be determined before its merits could be considered by the 16 judges.MORE ABOUT THE ATLANTIQUE CASEThe Atlantique case was ousted by the ICJ on the issue of jurisdiction and not on merits. Both parties had agreed that the question of jurisdiction would be decided first and only then would the issue of merits be taken up.Guillaume said the court would first have to decide whether it had the jurisdiction to go into the case as contended by New Delhi after the Indian delegation led by the then Attorney General Soli Sorabjee, raised preliminary objections to its jurisdiction.Pakistan opened the first round of oral arguments, India replying them, and then Pakistan following with its second round, with India making its response thereto.INDIA'S ARGUMENTSIndia argued that the court did not have jurisdiction in the matter, citing an exemption it had filed way back in 1974 to exclude disputes between India and other Commonwealth states, and disputes covered by multilateral treaties.Sorabjee told the court that Pakistan was 'solely responsible' for the incident and Islamabad must 'bear the consequences of its own acts.'Pakistan's Attorney General Aziz Munshi had sought a speedy resolution, saying its application had to be concluded quickly so that it did not remain an irritant in Indo-Pak relations.Pakistan had also sought to politicise the case by referring to the Kashmir issue, the Kargil conflict, Indo-Pak relations and alleged motives for the shooting.PAKISTAN'S ARGUMENTSPakistan wanted the court to intervene while India was opposed to its assumption of jurisdiction on the basis of Islamabad's application.It urged the court to ""dismiss the objections raised by India and accept its jurisdiction."" India maintained that none of Pakistan's arguments is 'sound' and does not provide a basis for invoking the court's jurisdiction.Sorabjee expressed happiness with the court's verdict.""We are very happy. The court has accepted all our contentions,"" he had said.Former supreme court judge B P Jeevan Reddy and Pakistan's former Attorney General Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada were co-opted into the bench as ad-hoc judges.ICJ RULES ON JUDGESAs per ICJ rules, when it does not include a judge possessing the nationality of the state party to a case, the state may appoint a person to sit as a judge ad-hoc for the purpose of the case.The court also recalled that its lack of jurisdiction does not relieve States of their obligation to settle their disputes by peaceful means.The choice of those means admittedly rests with the parties under Article 33 of the UN Charter, it said, adding, they are nonetheless under an obligation to seek such a settlement, and to do so in good faith in accordance with the Charter.As regards India and Pakistan, that obligation was restated more particularly in the Simla Accord of July 2, 1972. Moreover, the Lahore Declaration of 21 February, 1999 reiterated ""the determination of both countries to implementing the Simla Agreement,"" it said.SETTLE DISPUTES BY PEACEFUL MEANSAccordingly, the court reminded the parties of their obligation to settle their disputes by peaceful means, and in particular the dispute arising out of the Atlantique incident in conformity with the obligations which they have undertaken.India's External Affairs Ministry while hailing the verdict especially welcomed the court's positive observations on the principles enunciated in the Simla agreement and Lahore Declaration as the basis for an Indo-Pak rapprochement.Through its comments, the court has vindicated India's stand on these landmark agreements that are the very cornerstone of India-Pakistan relations, a ministry spokesman had said.Also Read:Kulbhushan Jadhav death sentence: Pakistan to overrule International Court of Justice's order",38,"Before the hearing on the death sentence awarded to Kulbhushan Jadhav, the last time India and Pakistan faced off at the International Court of Justice was nearly 18 years ago.

Duterte condemned insurgents for destroying infrastructure and alleged that the schools were operated by the rebels without government permits. Human rights groups demanded that Duterte retract the threat and warned such an attack would be a war crime.","The Philippine president has sparked alarm among human rights groups after he threatened to bomb tribal schools, accusing them of teaching students to become communist rebels.In a televised news conference on Monday, Rodrigo Duterte condemned insurgents for destroying bridges and torching schools in the countryside but said they were sparing indigenous Lumad schools, which he alleged were operating under rebel control without government permits. ?Get out of there, I?m telling the Lumads now. I?ll have those bombed, including your structures,? the president said. ?I will use the armed forces, the Philippine air force. I?ll really have those bombed ? because you are operating illegally and you are teaching the children to rebel against government.? Human rights groups called on him to retract the threat, warning such an attack would constitute a war crime. US-based Human Rights Watch said international humanitarian law ?prohibits attacks on schools and other civilian structures unless they are being used for military purposes?, adding that deliberate attacks on civilians, including students and teachers, ?is also a war crime?.Leftwing lawmaker Emmi de Jesus of the Gabriela Women?s party asked Duterte to retract the threat, saying government troops may use it as a pretext to attack indigenous schools and communities in the country?s south that have come under threat from pro-military militias in recent years. Angered by recent communist rebel attacks on government forces, including a road gun battle last week that wounded five members of his elite presidential guards, Duterte has called off peace talks with the Maoist guerrillas and threatened their perceived sympathisers.  ?By calling for an attack on schools Duterte is directing the military to commit war crimes,? said Carlos Conde of Human Rights Watch. Conde urged Duterte to sign a 2015 international political statement, the Safe Schools Declaration, that commits governments to supporting the protection of students, teachers and schools in times of armed conflict. Duterte ascended to the presidency in 2016 after campaigning on his extra-tough approach on crime as a prosecutor and later as mayor of southern Davao city. He has remained popular despite thousands of deaths in his nationwide anti-drug crackdown, and his continuing popularity and the ineffective opposition have apparently emboldened him. On Monday night Duterte also called for abolishing the Commission on Human Rights, an independent agency created under the constitution. He demanded that the commission and the government ombudsman, who investigates officials for corruption and other infractions, route requests to investigate police and military personnel through him, and laid down conditions under which he would allow those investigations. Duterte said that if the ombudsman failed to address atrocities committed by insurgents on government forces, ?so that you can get the truth and the whole story, then do not investigate my army and police.?

2989,"Around 46% cases pending in courts are against the Centre and states, according to data from the Ministry of Law and Justice. The Central government alone has 1.3 lakh pending cases against it. Further, the departments with most pending cases are railways (66,685), finance (15,651), communications (12,642), home affairs (11,668), defence (3,433) and health & family welfare (3,275).","At a time when the country's courts and justice ministry are battling a backlog of more than 3.2 crore cases, it turns out that the government - both Centre and states - is the biggest single litigant, being a party in a whopping 46 per cent of them. According to statistics provided by the law and justice ministry, the central government alone is involved in 1,35,060 lawsuits across the country. Experts say India has far too few courts, judges and prosecutors for its 1.3 billion people. Bulk of the cases is pending in subordinate courts thronged by poor litigants who bear the brunt of the creeping system. RAILWAY HAS MOST PENDING CASESThe ministry of railways is the biggest contributor, being a party in 66,685 pending lawsuits of which 10,464 are more than a decade old. Five other ministries with the most number of cases are finance (15,651), communications (12,642), home affairs (11,668), defence (3,433) and health & family welfare (3,275). Listing the Narendra Modi government's achievements in the arena of justice delivery in the last three years, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said a key goal is to reduce government litigation as a result of which the overall case pileup is set to witness a sharp dip. ""A draft national litigation policy is under formulation to make the government a responsible and efficient litigant. I wrote to all governmental departments and ministries to take pro-active measures to settle cases were government is a party,"" said Prasad. Ministry sources said to give an impetus to the goal, a nodal officer has been appointed in each department to keep a track of disputes in which the department is involved, avoid filing appeals except in cases that involve a substantial policy matter, and withdrawal of vexatious litigation.SETTLEMENT ON THE CARDSThe ministry is also making efforts to ensure cases involving two government wings or PSUs are settled out of the court using alternate dispute redress mechanisms. Pendency in the Supreme Court is now at 60,750 cases. About 40 lakh cases are stuck in high courts. The pendency in district and subordinate courts is at 2.74 crore. The department of justice's ""Action Plan To Reduce Government Litigation"" says, ""Government is regarded to be the biggest contributor to litigation in India. Approximately 46 per cent of the total pending cases in courts pertains to the government. This includes cases relating to Public Sector Undertakings and other autonomous bodies. Government litigation includes service matters, disputes with private entities as well as inter-se disputes between two government departments and disputes between two PSUs."" The Legal Information Management and Briefing System (LIMBS) - an endeavour to bring court cases against the government on a single comprehensive online platform - was launched last year. It was an effort to ensure that various ministries do not adopt conflicting stands on the same issue before a court, a growing trend these days, and to make maximum efforts to settle disputes between governments and among public sector units out of the court, which will reduce the backlog to a large extent. Prasad said LIMBS has captured details of more than 1,30,231 cases in which the government is involved. ""It helps to introduce transparency as well as a sense of ownership among various stakeholders/ministries/departments during the entire cycle of a court case,"" he said. The progress of each case - what happened on a particular date, stand adopted by the government, etc - will be available at the click of a button for the official who has registered himself with the LIMBS. Several recent chief justices had been asking the Centre to take immediate steps to ensure that only minimal litigation between government departments and PSUs reach the court.

This was Sri Lanka?s first-ever loss to Zimbabwe in a bilateral series and it continued their torrid run in 2017.Following Sri Lanka?s three-wicket loss to Zimbabwe in the final ODI at Hambantota which led to their series loss, Mathews had said that he was reconsidering his decision to be captain of Sri Lanka. ?It?s one of the lowest points in my career, and a hard one to swallow. Everything went against us, from the toss to misreading the wicket. But there are no excuses. At the end of the day we were not good enough to beat them. They played better cricket,? Mathews said.With his departure, Sri Lanka have little time to look for a captain. The team plays a one-off Test against Zimbabwe on July 14 while India tour the country for three Tests, five ODIs and a Twenty20I starting on July 26.

In 2016, Tharanga was at the helm when he led Sri Lanka to victory in the tri-series in Zimbabwe which also included the west Indies.Sri Lanka have endured a torrid time in 2017. They were eliminated in the first round of the ICC Champions Trophy while they were whitewashed 5-0 against South Africa. With this series loss to Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka are now under pressure for automatic qualification to the ICC World Cup in 2019 in England.

2521,A month-long study by the Centre for Science and Environment on 13 Delhi arterial roads has revealed that there is negligible difference between peak and non-peak hours for traffic. The study also found that vehicles were going 50%-60% slower than the speed the roads were originally built for. The analysis also indicated that traffic congestion is worse on weekends. ,"No matter what time you leave for work, chances are you will get stuck in the Capital?s traffic. A study by the Centre for Science and Environment has found that ?non-peak hours? have almost disappeared on Delhi?s main arterial roads, i.e., there is virtually no difference in travel time between peak and non-peak hours. The month-long CSE study on travel time and traffic speed monitored 13 arterial roads for 12 hours daily. While the average morning and evening peak speeds were recorded at 28kmph and 25kmph, the off-peak speed remained restricted to 27kmph. The analysis, which is based on data from Google Maps, shows that roads in Delhi are more congested on weekends, with an average peak speed of 25kmph, less than the weekday figure of 26kmph.  It was found that vehicles are plying 50%-60% slower than the speed these roads were built for.The 13 arterial roads that were part of the study included heavily congested ones such as Outer Ring Road; Swaroop Nagar to Wazirabad, Mahatma Gandhi Road (Ring Road); Indira Gandhi Stadium Complex to Majnu Ka Tilla and Sri Aurobindo Marg; Lado Sarai to Kidwai Nagar West. Arterial roads are primary networks that provide long-distance travel through multi-modal transport system connecting all major city-level land uses. They also facilitate inter-city and regional trips by connecting with highways and expressway networks.The analysis was done on the basis of data taken from Google Maps that was noted for every hour from 8 am to 8 pm in June.Traffic speedThe study found that all the 13 selected arterial roads had an average peak speed of 26 km/hr, while the off-peak speed was recorded at 27 km/hr, which is 50%-60% lower than the design speed. These roads have been designed to achieve a driving speed of 50-70 km/hr as per the Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning & Engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC) street design guidelines as well as Indian Road Congress guidelines for urban roads. The regulated speed is 40-55 km/hour.It was also seen that during the 12 hours of the day, around 75% of the time, the average speed is 25-30 km/hr. About 17% of the time, it is 20-25 km/hr and only 8% of the day?s time was the speed more than 30 km/hr.According to a 2010 report by RITES, the average peak speed in Delhi was 27.7 km/hr and off-peak was 30.8 km/hr ? now, this has come down to 26 km/hr and 28 km/hr.Weekends more congestedThe analysis breaks the myth that Delhi?s roads have less traffic during weekends. The analysis says that the average peak speed noted during weekends on these roads is 25 km/hr which is lower than the weekday speed of 26 km/hr. ?This even drops to 8 km/hr on Sri Aurobindo Marg and 9 km/hr on Mehrauli-Badarpur road during peak hours. Evening peaks are worse during weekends ? 21-23 km/hr in contrast to 25-27 km/hr on working days,? said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director-research and advocacy, CSE.While the average traffic speed on Saturday is 21 km/hour, on Sunday it improves slightly to 23 km/hour but remains still worse than weekdays, she added.Lutyens? roads less congested The study states that the average traffic speed in Lutyen?s Zone, which has primary arterial roads with widths up to 50 meters, is considerably higher. The average peak hour speed is 44 km/hr ? almost 40% higher than on other arterial roads. The average off-peak speed is 52 km/hr, which is almost double that on other arterials. There is also a considerable difference between the average peak and off-peak speed. Air pollution worsens with trafficCSE also analysed hourly air quality data for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) ? largely influenced by traffic ? for a selected day. It found that when the average morning peak speed of 28 km/hr drops to 25 km/hr in the evening, NO2 levels increase from 68 microgramme/cubic metre to 94 microgramme/cubic metre ? an increase of 38%. ?This can get worse during winter when inversion builds up during evening,? Roychowdhury said. Traffic from NCR citiesMost of the arterial roads are conduit for traffic from the neighboring NCR cities, the study states. Besides, there are some stretches that are chronically congested. On the stretch from Ambedkar Nagar to Lajpat Nagar on Lal Bahadur Shastri Marg, the average morning and evening peak speed was 16 km/hr and 17 km/hr. ?Speed can even drop to 5 km/hr during evening hours. On Sri Aurobindo Marg from Lado Sarai to Kidwai Nagar West, the average speed is 19 km/hr during the worst peak hours between 6 pm and 7 pm; during weekends it can drop to 7 km/hr,? she added.",46,A month-long study by the Centre for Science and Environment on 13 Delhi arterial roads has revealed that there is negligible difference between peak and non-peak hours for traffic.

3677,"RSS ideologue Indresh Kumar on Saturday said Muslims in India have realised that even Allah doesn't want an ""impure"" mosque at the disputed site in Ayodhya. The 15th-century structure was named after an individual (Babur) and so it could never be used by Muslims as they only worshipped one God, he said. Allah never accepted the structure, he added.","Senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue Indresh Kumar on Saturday said that Muslims in India have understood that even Allah doesn't want an 'impure' mosque at the disputed site in Ayodhya.Speaking to India Today, the veteran RSS functionary and convener of its minority cell - Muslim Rashtriya Manch said, ""Muslims have realised that since Allah himself has not allowed the mosque to come up there, it's unlikely that it will ever come up.""Questioning the legitimacy of the Babri Masjid, Kumar said that the 15th century structure was named after an individual (Babur) and so it could never be used by Muslims as they only worshiped one God.""The land is disputed and it was claimed after destroying a Ram temple that existed there, thus Allah never accepted the structure and even namaz was never conducted at the place. Today, Muslims have realized that it was an illegal structure,"" he explained.Going back in time, the veteran RSS ideologue blamed the dispute on a mistake by Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty in the subcontinent. TRY BABUR IN COURT ""The Ram Mandir in Ayodhya was destroyed by Babur 400 years ago. Had he not indulged in that act to build such an impure mosque, there would not have been such a predicament today. I would like to appeal to the courts of the land that if someone needs to be tried it should be Babur and his army general Mir Baqi,"" he added.At a time when the RSS backed Muslim Rashtriya Manch is backing the call for a Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, Kumar said that many in the community have stated that they don't want an 'illegal' mosque, especially one that was built on a disputed land.""They (Muslims) have realised that Ram and Khuda are all the same, they are one supreme power. The only difference being that one is abstract and the other takes the form of Lord Ram,"" he added.According to Kumar, the minority community in India now realises that those who are trying to encroach the land forcefully were neither following the principles of Quran nor the Prophet, but were only interested in continuing the stalemate.""They believe that Ram is like their Nabi or Paigambar and most definitely that of their ancestors, thus they want a Ram Temple in Ayodhya to end the dispute forever. They have understood that even though they may be Muslims by faith but in Hindustan their ancestors were all Hindus and their social and domestic customs too were that of the Hindus,"" Kumar said.Also read:Babri Masjid demolition: Supreme Court restores conspiracy charges against LK Advani, MM Joshi, Uma Bharti",16,"RSS ideologue Indresh Kumar on Saturday said Muslims in India have realised that even Allah doesn't want an ""impure"" mosque at the disputed site in Ayodhya.

The report has been submitted to the high court earlier this month.The city has seven domesticated elephants owned by four people. While six are kept at Sangam Vihar in Wazirabad, one is kept at a JJ cluster in Laxmi Nagar.The owners of the elephants have requested the forest officials not to separate them from the elephants as the animals would die without them. They have instead requested the forest department to give them a plot of land where they can move with the animals. ?We have asked the owners to respond within four weeks. If they don?t respond, we would shift the elephants to some area outside Delhi,? said AK Shukla, chief wildlife warden of Delhi In 2016, a committee comprising wildlife officials had recommended that all the elephants should be confiscated as their health was poor and the animals were kept in bad conditions. The owners, however, moved court challenging the committee?s report. In May 2017, a separate committee was formed on the orders of the court which inspected the elephants again. The report was submitted earlier this month. The five-member committee comprised officials of the forest department, the central zoo authority and the vet of the National Zoological Park in New Delhi. The committee, after inspecting the animals, found that not only the elephants were kept in poor conditions but it was also risky to keep the elephants in crowded localities. A number of cases have been earlier reported where domesticated elephants have gone on a rampage killing people. ?Housing elephants inside a crowded and congested colony is a high-risk affair. The risk was compounded as there were neither any secondary barriers to restrain the elephants in case they broke the chain with which they are tied, nor there were any tranquilising guns or medicines to restrict them,? the report said. The committee found that most of the animals were suffering from poor health which suggests that they were not properly fed and don?t undertake exercises such as long walks. They have cracked nails which suggest they have very poor foot care. ?Sometimes they are made to walk through a maze of traffic dust and exhaust fumes which they may find terrifying? the report states. The committee has also raised questions about their ownerships. The report states that most of the elephants have no proper ownership certificates. ?The elephants are like our family members. We would die without them. We have proper license to keep them. It is only because of some animal right activists and influential NGOs that we are being made victims. We will again approach the court if necessary,? said Yusuf Ali, whose family owns three elephants.

His mother is not in a good way health-wise after what has happened so it was decided she should not attend,? the newspaper quoted a source as saying.The family feared any ceremony could be too traumatic and draw negative attention.Butt?s friends and associates were not notified of the burial.Butt was the ringleader of the attack in London Bridge and nearby Borough Market last month.He and two others drove a van into pedestrians before stabbing and slashing revellers enjoying a night out.Seven victims died, dozens were hurt and Butt and the two other terrorists were shot dead.Butt became radicalised after watching hate preachers on YouTube before becoming linked to Al Muhajiroun, the banned extremist group whose leader, Anjem Choudary, is in jail and now moved to an isolation unit.

57,"Producer of 'Babumoshai Bandookbaaz' Kiran Shroff, while talking about sexist comments she faced, has said that a Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) member asked her how she could make a film like this being a woman. A male member added, ""But she is not a woman. Look at what she is wearing."" Kiran said that such thoughts were regressive.","The CBFC (Central Board of Film Certification) seems to have forgotten that their job is to certify, not censor. The latest victim of their scissors is Nawazuddin Siddiqui-starrer Babumoshai Bandookbaaz. The Pahlaj Nihalani-led board ordered a whopping 48 cuts to the film, and when India Today Television reached out to him, he said, ""We are just doing our job.""But this is not the worst of it. Disparaging sexist comments were allegedly made by CBFC members about the producer, Kiran Shroff, for green-lighting a film with such 'abusive' content. According to a report in Bombay Times, a female member asked her how she, as a woman, could be involved in the making of a film with so many abuses. At this point, a male member is said to have interjected, ""Inhone to pant-shirt pehni hai. Yeh aurat thodi hi hain.""Kiran told the publication, ""They had an internal discussion for an hour after the screening. First, they told us that they were giving us an A certificate. Then they told us that there are 48 cuts. We argued that if the film is for adults, then why have so many cuts. They didn't bother much, and continued to explain each cut and their logic behind it.""She added, ""In the middle of that, a lady officer turned to me and said, 'Aap aurat hokar aisi filmein kaise bana sakti hain'. And before I could speak up, a man in the committee said, 'But she is not a woman. Look at what she is wearing.' I was dumbfounded. This is such a regressive thought... Sadly, this is the kind of humiliation producers have to put up with. If they are judging me by my clothes, I can imagine the parameters they must have used to pass my film.""Babumoshai Bandookbaaz has been directed to do away with abusive words as well as 80 per cent of its ""humping"" scenes. Director Kushan Nandy was appalled and told the daily, ""First and foremost, we don't have humping scenes. They are love-making scenes. I am shocked and appalled with what has happened. If you notice the cuts, there's a sentence, 'Yeh kaahe ka c******a hai'. We use such sentences in our everyday life. The excuse given to us is that children also sneak into cinema halls to watch adult films. How is that my problem? Penalise the cinema halls for this, not the producers. The way they have dealt with our film is insulting. They humiliated Kiran which is unpardonable.""Apparently, the filmmaker has been asked to get rid of a bunch of sentences with the word ""khada"" in it. He met Pahlaj Nihalani in private to discuss the directives, but the CBFC chief had a shocking response - ""You are lucky I'm not banning your film.""Kushan said, ""When I argued that there are no grounds to do that, he retorted, 'What are these abuses? Do you plan to make a dictionary of bad words?' He even asked me to change lines like 'Maa ka lehenga' to 'Maa ka anchal'. In short, the essence of what is being said is lost. He told me, 'C*****a ko tutiya kar do.' He is basically trying to teach us to make a film. And finally, he told me to remove the line that has 'Khada' in it. He said, 'I will never let it pass because I am abused for my song Khada Hai Khada Hai to this day.' I'll fight this till the end.""Pahlaj Nihalani refused to comment on the matter.At a media interaction today, Kiran Shroff shared all that the CBFC members told her.

However, the 40-year-old said he was not being judgemental, adding, ""I imagine how difficult parenting is today.""","An Italian restaurateur fed up with his customers? lunches being interrupted by rowdy children has come up with a novel solution: a discount for well-behaved families.Antonio Ferrari, who owns a wine bar in the northern city of Padua that caters to families on Sundays, came up with the idea when he spotted a party of 11 at one of his tables, including five children sitting ?with much composure?.Ferrari rewarded the group with a 5% sconto, and has since bestowed the same discount on two other families with well-mannered children.Ferrari told the Guardian he estimated about 30% of parents did not know how to handle their children at lunchtime, and that too often children run around the restaurant and bother other customers, forcing his waiting staff to swerve to avoid them.Long family lunches, sometimes stretching to three hours, are still an honoured culinary and social tradition in Italy, though less prevalent than they once were. Usually the meal involves an antipasto ? bruschetta or platters of prosciutto are fairly typical ? and then a pasta dish, followed by a meat dish and then vegetables.Unlike the disciplined French children portrayed by Pamela Druckerman in her book Bringing up Bébé who sit quietly through restaurant meals as their parents engage in adult conversation, Italian families are stereotypically more rowdy, with loud behaviour often indulged by parents who see it as as a normal childhood phenomenon.  Ferrari ? who does not have children ? was at pains to point out that his intention was not to be too judgmental, telling Corriere della Sera: ?I imagine how difficult parenting is today.?Nevertheless, he thought something had to be done to rein-in children splashing water in the restaurant?s bathrooms and bothering other customers by running around tables.He recalled some parents telling him his restaurant was essentially public, and that they could do what they want. But he added: ?I?m responsible for what happens in it.?The party who earned the coveted discount were delighted by the news and left a ?30 (£25) tip, Ferrari said.

In our opinion, the impugned legislation has proved to be totally counterproductive and cannot be sustained.""This is the first time that bar dancers themselves have come forward to oppose the Maharashtra law.Till now the challenge was only from hotel, restaurant and dance bar owners.

127,A ticket examiner was allegedly stabbed on Sunday by one of the three passengers when he asked them to deboard a train for traveling without tickets in Delhi. The victim said that the accused had boarded a reserved coach and stabbed his arm with a sharp-edged weapon when he tried to be stern in asking them to deboard.,"A train ticket examiner (TTE) was allegedly stabbed by three unidentified men who were asked to deboard the train as they were travelling without tickets in the reserved compartment. The incident took place on a train that was moving from the New Delhi railway station late Sunday night.The injured TTE was rushed to a private hospital in Ghaziabad after the government railway police (GRP) stopped the train at Ghaziabad junction.Diwakar Boro, the TTE who is based in Guwahati, was examining tickets onboard the Poorvottar Sampark Kranti Express, which had left the New Delhi railway station around 11.45pm for Guwahati on Sunday. The victim was allegedly stabbed by one of the three young men, who then jumped out of the moving train.?I asked the three men to deboard the train as they did not have tickets. They had boarded a reserved coach of the train. Instead, they asked me not to bother and also hurled abuses when I tried to be stern in asking them to deboard. They looked like locals and were aged 18-22 years. However, one of them hit me with a sharp-edged weapon,? Boro said.?Initially, I did not realise that I was injured. But when I saw blood, I realised that it was a deep cut on my arm. Other passengers later pulled the chain and informed a guard.

2523,"US President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the FBI, Christopher Wray, has rejected the President's claim that an inquiry into alleged Russian hacking of the US election is a 'witch hunt'. Adding that he will never allow the FBI to be driven by anything other than facts, Wray said he would quit if Trump asks him to do anything illegal.","Breaking with the President, the lawyer Donald Trump picked to lead the FBI declared Wednesday that he does not believe a special counsel investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign is a ?witch hunt?.Christopher Wray, the former high-ranking Justice Department official whom Trump nominated last month, also told senators at his confirmation hearing that he would never let politics get in the way of the bureau?s mission.The FBI?s work will be driven only by ?the facts, the law and the impartial pursuit of justice,? he said, asserting his independence. ?My loyalty is to the Constitution and the rule of law. They have been my guideposts throughout my career, and I will continue to adhere to them no matter the test.?Trump has repeatedly derided as a ?hoax? and a ?witch hunt? an ongoing investigation by the FBI and Robert Mueller, the former FBI director selected in May as the special counsel to oversee the probe.Wray, selected for the FBI job last month after Trump fired James Comey, made clear that he disagreed with the characterization.?I do not consider Director Mueller to be on a witch hunt,? he said under questioning from Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.He pledged to lead the FBI ?without regard to any partisan political influence? and said he would consider unacceptable any efforts to interfere with Mueller?s investigation.After Trump dismissed Comey on May 9, the ex-FBI director said that the President had asked him to pledge his loyalty during a dinner at the White House months earlier. He also said Trump had encouraged him to end an investigation into the former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Wray said Trump made no demand for loyalty from him.Wray, 50, would inherit the nation?s top law enforcement agency at a particularly challenging time, given the abrupt dismissal of Comey by a president who has appeared insensitive to the bright-line boundary between the White House and the FBI.Wray?s lengthy legal career included a stint as a top Justice Department official in the Bush administration and white collar work at an international law firm with several major corporations and banks as clients. He served the government at a time when harsh interrogation techniques were approved within the Justice Department for terror suspects captured overseas, though Wray said he was never involved in signing off on those methods.Though Trump as a candidate professed support for waterboarding, Wray said he considered torture to be wrong and ineffective. ?The FBI is going to play no part in the use of any techniques of that sort.?Wray was announced as the nominee in a curt, early morning tweet by Trump, and without the pageantry of a Rose Garden ceremony. So the hearing offered the first public, close-up look at him and his background.Several senators stated that they feel he is ?the right man for the job.? Attorneys and FBI agents who have worked with him describe him as a steady hand, dedicated and low-key, seemingly impervious to political influence.An association representing the majority of FBI agents on Monday voiced its support for Wray, saying ?he understands the nature of investigative work and the centrality of special agents to the mission of the FBI.?Bill Mateja, a Dallas attorney who worked with Wray in the Justice Department, said ?he has a great moral compass and he?s no one?s minion.?Wray also faced questions about his relationships with Comey and Mueller. Trump allies have said Mueller?s closeness to Comey shows he can?t lead an unbiased probe. But Trump nominated Wray despite his having worked with both men in the Justice Department.Wray was at the department in 2004 when Comey, then the deputy attorney general, was prepared to resign during a dispute with the White House over the reauthorization of a domestic surveillance program. Wray stopped Comey in the hallway one night amid resignation rumors with a particular request, according to the 2011 book, ?The Threat Matrix.??Look, I don?t know what?s going on, but before you guys all pull the rip cords, please give me a heads-up so I can jump with you,? Wray is quoted as saying.Those who know him say that unlike the outspoken Comey, Wray would be a more reserved leader. His reserve could bode well for the agency at a time when its work has been thrust into the center of a political maelstrom.He has deep experience in Washington, having served as head of the Justice Department?s criminal division in the Bush administration, a position that had him overseeing major criminal prosecutions ? such as the special task force investigating the Enron collapse ? and also developing the US government?s legal response to terrorism and national security threats.Over the past decade, he has worked in private practice at King & Spalding in Atlanta, where he?s defended large corporations and financial institutions in criminal and civil cases.He provided legal services to Johnson & Johnson, Wells Fargo, Credit Suisse and fantasy sports providers DraftKings and FanDuel, among other big-name clients, according to ethics documents released Monday. If confirmed, he?ll have to step aside for a year from matters involving those clients and the law firm. He also assisted New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie during the so-called Bridgegate scandal.",47,"US President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the FBI, Christopher Wray, has rejected the President's claim that an inquiry into alleged Russian hacking of the US election is a 'witch hunt'.

3846,Karnataka Water Resources Minister MB Patil has said that the state has just enough water for drinking purposes till June 15. Patil also urged the people of Karnataka to use water judiciously. The state has been reeling under a severe drought for the past three years and available live storage in the state's reservoirs has reached an all-time low.,"Karnataka water resources minister MB Patil has appealed to the state's denizens to use water judiciously, reminding them that there's just enough water for drinking purposes till June 15.Patil today held a meeting with officials belonging to various departments, to work out how best to optimally use water until the onset of the monsoon. With Karnataka reeling under a severe drought for the past three years, the state government is leaving no stone unturned to ensure that citizens aren't facing too much trouble. But with the available live storage in the reservoirs touching an all-time low, there's very little the government can do to supply continuous drinking water.As of today, this is the level of water in the state's reservoirs.- Almatti dam: 12 TMC (TMC - one thousand million cubic feet)- Narayanapura dam: 15 TMC- Hidkal dam: 7.6 TMC- Hipparge dam : 0.8 TMC- Malaprabha dam: 1.7 TMC- Tungabhadra dam: 3.7 TMC- Bhadra: 8.5 TMC- KRS: 4.438 TMC- Kabini dam: 0.295 TMC- Harangi dam: 1.228 TMC- Hemavathi dam: 1.787 TMCWATER RATIONING BEGINS?""We will coordinate with different departments and ensure that as a team there will be efficient use of water,"" Patil said.

Clive Lewis has shifted his stance on article 50 quite considerably over the last seven days. A week ago he told his local paper, the Eastern Daily Press, that he could not vote for an article 50 bill on the basis of the government?s current plans. He told the paper:It is safe to say that I am deeply concerned at the direction that Theresa May and the Conservative government is taking these negotiations, and the developments that are taking place. I am very mindful of what the majority of constituents in Norwich South voted for, which is remain. I don?t think what is currently on the table, given the irreversibility of article 50, means that signing article 50 under these conditions is in the best interests of people in Norwich or the country. However it is the job of the opposition to see what we can get between now and March 31 in terms of assurances and guarantees and I think that will be critical to many people when they come to make their decision on this vote.Within the last week the government has announced it will publish a white paper about its plans.

The whole country should be involved in determining our shared future, which is why Labour has fought for the British people to have a say, through parliament.Labour will seek to amend the bill to prevent the government using Brexit to trash our rights, public services, jobs and living standards while cutting taxes for the wealthiest.

He may have been tagged as a ?serial-kisser? in the beginning of his career, but the actor has no reason to shy away from talking about it.?A number of my films in which I was shown kissing did very well in the beginning of my career. So that tag naturally became a part of me. People like to label and box things up, and you just can?t hold that against them. And frankly, this was not something I was running away from. I will be honest. I have benefited a lot from it,? says the actor.After all these years, Emraan feels that now it?s time to do away with the tag, as in the long run, it can restrict his growth as an actor. ?When you evolve as an actor and try to explore new and varied avenues, the tag becomes sort of a deterrent for you. People tend to like you more in a particular kind of role. But for every actor, there is a saturation point. I think I have reached it now, and need to find new kind of roles,? says the 38-year old, who will be seen in the thriller Baadshaho, which releases on September 1. The makers of the multi-starrer film, which also features actors Ajay Devgn, Ileana D?Cruz and Esha Gupta, recently released the first song, which has been climbing up the charts. But what every Emraan fan is looking forward to is the song Piya More, which will be out tomorrow. The song pairs Emraan with actor Sunny Leone for the first time. Emraan is all praise for the 36-year old actor. ?Sunny is a thorough professional. I segregate actors into two types ? ones who are constantly fussy about everything on the sets, and the others who are okay with everything, without any fusses. I think she comes under the second category. It was an absolute joy shooting with her, since she?s a much better dancer than I am!? says Emraan.Follow @htshowbiz for more",27,"Actor Emraan Hashmi has said he benefitted a lot from the 'serial kisser' tag.

Mohan, 47, who was brought from the United States in 1974, died without mating. The zoo officials failed to find him a female partner in over four decades of his stay, despite him experiencing mood swings and exhibiting violent tendencies such as banging against the enclosure, which officials attributed to his ?frustration over sexual inactivity?.In 2005, Mohan was diagnosed with paratuberculosis, or Johne?s Disease, which is contagious, chronic and often fatal for ruminants such as cows but can also strike hindgut fermenters such as horses and rhinos. Zoo officials said they never expected Mohan to recover. ?He was too old to eat. His system was refusing to take food even in liquid form. He had battled diseases earlier, but gave up the fight at 11.30pm yesterday (Tuesday),? Tejas Mariswamy, the zoo?s divisional forest officer (DFO), told HT on Wednesday.  The official explained than the average lifespan of rhinos is 45 to 50 years.Mohan, bought for Rs 50,000 from Southwitch Birds and Animals Inc in Black Stone, US, had attained sexual maturity three years after he landed at the zoo on December 22, 1974. He was long past his sexual prime when he developed the disease in 2005, by which time officials began describing the possibility of bringing a mating partner for him as ?dangerous?. ?Sadly, Mohan died without mating because a female white rhino could not be found in India,? Mariswamy said. Officials said Mohan could have been paired with a captive Indian female rhino. But the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) had in 1986 banned cross-mating of animals belonging to different species. The CZA?s move was in tune with the worldwide decision to stop hybridisation of big cats after the Alipore Zoo, Kolkata, had experimented with litigons (a cross between a lion and a tigress) and tigons (a tiger and a lioness) in the 1970s . Sangeeta Goswami of People For Animals said Mohan?s death is a reminder that feral animals should not be made to undergo life in captivity. ?The African rhino was denied sexual rights for no fault of his,? she said. A spokesperson of People for Ethical Treatment to Animals said, ?Captive breeding of animals in zoos is unethical, even if it means depriving a rhino its right to reproduction.?

However, a recipient can take home gifts valued under ?5,000.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his fans and followers say, is a tireless man, working deep into the night without keeping track of time.But from among numerous gifts Modi received during foreign trips this year, he took home a wristwatch manufactured by British company Sekonda, besides a couple of smaller items, according to official documents.Ministers and officials have to deposit all gifts at the toshakhana, the official repository of the external affairs ministry.Any gift valued less than Rs 5000 can be kept by the recipient. For gifts above Rs 5000, they have to pay the additional amount, said an official of the toshakhana who is from the Central Board of Customs and Excise.The watch, entered as a Sekonda ?House of Commons? wristwatch, was valued at Rs 3,500. Besides the watch, the PM also took a decorative porcelain valued at Rs 1000. Among the gifts received by Modi between January and March are a model of the fabled Sha?bi housing model of the United Arab Emirates, a decorative sculpture with Argillite carving and a Mont Blanc ballpoint pen.These six gift items among the 83 latest entries at the toshakhana.The Mont Blanc pen is valued at Rs 2500 and is kept at the toshakhana. Also deposited at the repository is the model of Emirati National House, valued at Rs 4500 and a the decorative sculpture with Argillite carving, valued at Rs 2000.

617,"British cyclist Chris Froome won his third consecutive and fourth overall Tour de France, finishing the race in 86 hours 20 minutes 55 seconds in Paris on Sunday. The 32-year-old rider, who finished the event with a 54-second lead, has moved within one win of the all-time record. The 3,540-km 23-day long Grand Tour, featured a total of 198 riders.","The French capital was in lockdown on Sunday, with extra rings of security around the Champs Élysées, which had been turned into a vast sterile zone as a foretaste of what awaits the French capital when the Olympics arrive in either 2024 or 2028. In an understandable attempt to put Paris on display as never before, the race was routed through the Grand Palais with the riders racing under the famous glass roof, originally erected in 1897 for the universal exposition of the turn of the century.For Chris Froome it was but a novel diversion en route to confirmation of his fourth Tour de France victory. The Team Sky rider crossed the line in the bunch behind the stage winner, Dylan Groenewegen, to win the yellow jersey by 54 seconds from Rigoberto Urán.Bike races have been sent through buildings before ? there is a legendary kermis in Belgium which went through a bar full of drinkers and cyclo-cross races are sometimes sent through beer tents ? but this was about more than merely upping the returns in adjacent brasseries. Coming as it did the day after the start and finish in Marseille?s Stade Vélodrome ? albeit far from full due to the fact that few ticket holders wanted to stay in the stands all day ? the Grand Palais detour was further evidence that the Tour is constantly looking for new ways to reinvent itself, and a reminder that it increasingly sees itself as a way of showing this multifaceted country to the world.Lockdown could serve as a metaphor for the Tour as a whole, given the way the overall battle had panned out since the race left Düsseldorf 22 days ago. In four of the five previous Tours, Team Sky had brought their cycling version of catenaccio to bear on the race, but they had never done so to the extent they managed this year, with the yellow jersey only eluding them for two days once Geraint Thomas had won the opening time trial. For kilometre after kilometre the white train ground out the pace on the front, up hill and down dale, at times lining out the entire race when on paper it was not strictly necessary.As Froome?s fourth win loomed large, it was inevitable that at least one French newspaper ? Le Figaro, as it turned out ? would describe the Tour winner using Antoine Blondin?s sublime pun, ?gérant de la route? ? a wordplay on the verb gérer, meaning to manage or regulate, and the hoary French cliche for the Tour riders, les géants de la route. An English translation might be accountancy on wheels. Or to paraphrase Geoff Nicholson, hoarding seconds like supermarket discount coupons.Froome himself said that this was his and Team Sky?s chosen approach. ?We knew in Düsseldorf that it would be tight. It was always the tactic to ride this as a three-week race, not to go out on one day to blow it up, smash it for the stage win ? just chipping away every stage to make sure there were no massive losses. That?s normal when on a bad day in the mountains you can lose minutes. It?s been about doing it in the most conservative and efficient manner. That?s what Grand Tour racing is.?Compare and contrast with Dan Martin, who treats the key days like individual one-day classics, but ? before you veer too strongly towards espousing Martin?s philosophy ? bear in mind who actually won.Fourth Tour wins are the penultimate step to cycling greatness, but often do little to warm the soul at the time. This could certainly be said of the three that I can personally recall: Lance Armstrong in 2002 (with the usual proviso that it has been struck off), Miguel Indurain in 1994 and Bernard Hinault in 1982. They seem to be ones for the record books rather than the heart, but they can be turned by an individual?s approach. Hinault, in 1982, faced the same issue that confronted Froome as he approached Paris on Sunday: a Tour without a stage win, and the consequent carps about a lack of panache.The Badger?s response was to win the bunch sprint on the Champs Élysées, but this is not one from the Froome copybook. Having said that, Froome?s great strength over his four victories is his ability to adapt to whatever the Tour organisers present to him, and whatever fate decrees. 2013 had a wealth of time trialling and an immensely tough finale in the Alps; in 2015 there were cobbles and a team time trial but barely any individual time trials, while in 2016 there was more time trialling and a downhill finale into Morzine, in teeming rain, not to mention the run up Mont Ventoux.He is a champion who has versatility and grit, if not charisma or popularity. His approach to the latter is summed up by his answer to the question of why he felt he did not need to give press conferences on the rest days. ?Rest days are meant to be rest days and a big press conference is not good for recovery. I felt it helped me being able to switch off.? If Froome chooses to pursue a ?marginal gain? by hiding from a 15-minute discussion with the people whose job it is to present his personality to the world, he can hardly complain if his personality is not understood or appreciated for what it is. This is the Team Sky approach of winning at all costs; in this case the cost has to be borne by him.For the neutral there was much unbridled bike racing by individuals of character and panache to be savoured through the 2017 Tour, with the unfortunate proviso that very little of it actually involved the battle for the overall title. Some days will live in the memory: the moyenne montagne stage to Les Rousses won by Lilian Calmejane, Steve Cummings?s attempt to take the stage to Peyragudes, Sunweb?s battle with Quick-Step on the road to Romans-sur-Isère on behalf of their sprinters Mike Matthews and Marcel Kittel, Alberto Contador?s raging against the dying of the light en route to Foix and Serre-Chevalier, and Edvald Boasson Hagen?s cunning on Friday at Salon-de-Provence.Two stages can be seen as key episodes in the picaresque three-week soap opera: the Düsseldorf time trial, because of the time gained by Froome, and the message it sent about the probable outcome in Marseille three weeks later, and Chambéry, with the crash that eliminated Richie Porte ? whose BMC team looked second strongest to Sky ? and which put Daniel Martin physically and temporally on the back foot for the rest of the race.What of the opposition? They fell upon a Froome who was probably not as strong as in the past, but who had the nous, the sangfroid and the team to get him cycling?s greatest prize. ?At the moment we?re not ready to beat Chris Froome. Most teams aren?t,? said Orica-Scott?s director sportive Matt White, who placed a Yates brother in the top 10 and the white jersey of best under-25 for the second year running.?We?ll be coming back with a leader next year to try to beat Chris. Everyone is beatable. The model that Sky run and how they race makes it difficult. I?ve no idea what it?s a sign of but this year in general we haven?t seen him at the level of the past. That level was still good enough to win the Tour de France, and that shows the class of the man.?",61,"British cyclist Chris Froome won his third consecutive and fourth overall Tour de France, finishing the race in 86 hours 20 minutes 55 seconds in Paris on Sunday.

2385,"US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that his proposed wall along the US-Mexico border will need to be transparent so that people on the US side do not get hit by massive sacks of drugs being tossed over it. Trump earlier proposed attaching solar panels, saying the panels would provide cheap energy to pay for the wall.","Donald Trump doesn?t see the need for a proposed border wall to stretch the length of the roughly 2,000-mile (3,218 km) frontier with Mexico.Instead, he envisions ?anywhere from 700 (1,126 km) to 900 miles (1,448 km) of see-through wall?.Trump?s comments on the wall are the most definitive description he has given on what became a primary campaign promise. During the campaign he vowed to oversee construction of a ?big beautiful wall, with a big beautiful door? to let approved immigrants come into the United States.But on his way to Paris, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One: ?It?s a 2,000-mile border, but you don?t need 2,000 miles of wall because you have a lot of natural barriers. You have mountains. You have some rivers that are violent and vicious. You have some areas that are so far away that you don?t really have people crossing.?There are already about 650 miles (1,046 km) of fencing along the border, all of which is see-through.Trump?s remarks were informal and initially not allowed to be reported. The White House later provided a partial transcript of them.The Mexican border in much of Texas is defined by the Rio Grande, though parts of that river are little more than a trickle of water. About 24 miles (38 km) of the border in Arizona is marked by the Colorado river.Trump also said the wall ?needs transparency?.?You have to be able to see through it,? Trump said, adding that border agents need to know what or who is on the other side of the fence to avoid being hit by sacks of drugs and other contraband.?As horrible as it sounds, when they throw the large sacks of drugs over, and if you have people on the other side of the wall, you don?t see them. They hit you on the head with 60 pounds (27 kg) of stuff? It?s over,? Trump said.Drug smugglers have tried to fling bundles of drugs over parts of the roughly 650 miles of border that already has fencing or other barriers, using tactics including sling shots and catapults. But it?s unclear if anyone has ever been injured by the flying contraband.This year the government issued two notices for border wall proposals. The first called for a solid structure up to 30 ft (9.14 meters) high that couldn?t be easily breached. The second bid notice called for other types of walls, including something that could be seen through.Homeland security secretary John Kelly has said that border agents need to be able to see what is on the other side of a barrier for security and safety reasons. He has repeatedly said that Trump?s proposed wall would not be ?sea to shining sea?, from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Gulf of Mexico in the east.",29,"US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that his proposed wall along the US-Mexico border will need to be transparent so that people on the US side do not get hit by massive sacks of drugs being tossed over it.

In her 3-page resignation letter, she detailed the morning?s incident as the reason for her decision, which technically is a breach of protocol. A parliamentarian cannot cite a motive or reason for quitting, parliamentary procedure dictates. If people in power, the Bharatiya Janata Party or the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) does not allow me to speak in the interest of marginalised communities, then I can no longer continue in this Parliament, she said in the letter written in Hindi.Minister of state for parliamentary affairs Mukthar Abbas Naqvi said Mayawati had insulted the chair by threatening to resign. ?She must apologise.?He said the government was prepared to raise all issues.

This is in contradiction to the NGT's report, which claimed that it would take at least 10 years and ?42 crore to fix the damage caused by the event.","A scientific report prepared by Art of Living claimed that any ?accidental damage? to the ecology of the Yamuna floodplains caused by the Art of Living?s cultural event in 2016 has already been restored by nature.This contradicts the earlier findings by the National Green Tribunal-appointed seven-member expert committee, which claimed that it would take at least 10 years and Rs42 crore to fix the physical and biological damages caused to the river?s floodplains by the event.?If at all any such accidental damage would have taken place during the event, in all probability they have already been reversed by natural processes. With the arrival of monsoon in 2016, all the lost plants and animals would have re-colonised the event site,? the foundation?s report has claimed. Instead the NGO report has hinted that removal of shrubs, tall grasses, aquatic vegetation and reeds from the event site, which the NGT panel had dubbed as harmful to the floodplains, is actually beneficial to the ecology as it also helped remove invasive exotic species such as water hyacinth.Experts from both the NGT?s panel and the foundation?s team refused to comment on this ongoing war between scientists and experts of the two panels. Art of Living had filed a 200-page parallel report in the NGT to counter the allegations levelled against it. The foundation, founded by spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, which has been in the centre of controversy, had roped in at least 15 experts to prepare a scientific report. Experts in the Art of Living?s panel also alleged that satellite images, which forms one of the main pillars of the report submitted by the NGT-appointed panel, has been misinterpreted. The NGT panel had used satellite images and ground reports while claiming that large tracts of wetlands and water bodies were filled up for the event. ?One of the most glaring mistakes made in the report is the declaration of dry farmlands as huge tract of wetlands filled with water and several water bodies etc. Even the agricultural crops have been considered as wetland vegetation with shallow to deep water beneath them,? the NGO?s report has claimed. The experts pointed out that even the Survey of India?s report and National Wetland Atlas prepared by Space Application Centre have no mention of any such wetlands. The atlas had listed around 399 wetlands, including 301 micro wetlands in Delhi alone. The foundation?s report has also challenged the NGT-panel?s allegations that nearly 420 acres of Yamuna floodplains were damaged. Experts questioned how can an event, held over 25 acres of land, damage 420 acres of floodplains.The NGT panel had accused the foundation of levelling and compacting the soil resulting in heavy damage to the floodplains as it stopped the soil?s gaseous exchange and played havoc with the ground water recharging system. Experts who prepared the foundation?s report, however, claimed that compaction if any was done much earlier when construction of guide banks, DND and Barapullah drain were going on. ?It is impossible for even a practicing geophysicist to claim that ground was levelled or compacted without a geophysical study,? says the reports.

The police control room (PCR) department has decided to procure high-definition (HD) video cameras (handycams) and keep them in 1,000 PCR vans that are the first responders to any crime scene. The handycams would be used by the in-charge of patrol vans to record the crime scene, gathering of people, and areas around the spot, apart from recording statements of the witnesses, all in digital format. This video recording will be handed over to the investigating officer, who can use it as digital evidence in the court. ?The objective of the initiative is to get first-hand evidence of any crime and use it to make the case stronger against the accused,? said a senior police officer.In the current scenario, the officer said, evidence collection is the investigating officer?s job and the officer takes the help of forensic experts to lift samples. A lot of evidence and witnesses are lost or gone from the crime scene because the forensic experts and investigators generally reach late, mostly after some key witnesses leave the spot. ?But as our PCR vans act as first responders to any crime and reach the spot first, sometimes in less than a minute or two, it will be easy for us to capture such key evidence using the video cameras,? the officer said. ?There have been instances where suspects were present at the crime scene after the crime, monitoring the police activities and probe. Video recordings of the spots can help us identify and prosecute them based on the video footage.?Another police official said that the video cameras can be used for multi-tasking. Apart from crime spots, patrol van officials can use video cameras during demonstrations, riots, processions and other public gatherings, which at times witness violence as protestors resort to stone pelting on public servants and damaging private and public property. The recordings of such gatherings can be used by the police at a later stage to nail the trouble mongers. At present, as many as 500 patrol vans are equipped with ?phablets? that are used as call receiver and navigator. Since these phablets have in-built cameras, they can be used for video recordings too. ?The idea is to train our patrol van staff in making videos of crime scene...

To some, Nolan is a god, and his temple?s walls, dark and foreboding, seem to push in as the lights go down. Your senses, usually dulled by a mundane existence, are heightened. You?ve never experienced anything like it.The crowd?s hushed tones hit you in waves, and even the most distant whisper is deafening ? but it reassures as much as it startles. There are others like you. And like you, they?ve waited years for this moment. You are not alone. And the electricity you?ve created ? together ? in the cavernous place of worship, could power a small town.I have experienced this sensation on four occasions, before four Christopher Nolan films, and each of those experiences were, and remain to this day, some of the most special I?ve had inside a movie theatre.And yesterday, it happened again.Dunkirk, a film about men, created by men, is a force of nature ? an elemental beast of a movie about finding the meaning of life surrounded by the meaninglessness of war. It is an existential masterpiece set across three parallel plots destined to collide, which in turn are set on three planes of existence ? earth, air, and water. To us, these elements symbolise life, but in Dunkirk, they might as well be harbingers of death, having suspended our characters in their purgatory as they await judgment.On the land, in the seaside French town of Dunkirk, 400,000 soldiers have been pushed by ?the enemy? ? curiously, not once are the Nazis mentioned ? towards the sea. They wait, bombarded from behind, and up above, for deliverance. Before them lies a seemingly endless expanse of blue ? and home, England, is practically within sight, across the choppy waters of the Channel. They go from boat to boat ? some even conning their way onto the rickety barges ? desperate to get off the cursed beach, as torpedoes attack them from below, and missiles rain like hellfire from the sky.They?re in need of a miracle.But help is on its way. Tom Hardy protects them from above, acting, like he did in The Dark Knight Rises, through a mask, and only with his eyes. And his eyes are all he needs to convey the (sometimes scarily suicidal) determination to save his countrymen, as he picks off one Luftwaffe fighter after another ? even as his wingmen perish, and his fuel gauge begs him to stop.Below him, on the water, a civilian Mark Rylance has commandeered a boat, one of the many deployed by the Navy in an effort to aid the evacuation process. With his teenage son, and his son?s eager friend in tow ? but without a firm plan ? he sails into war.And with the precision of a watchmaker ? time is an oft-repeated motif in the film ? Nolan, a master working at the peak of his powers, puts the pieces of this jigsaw together with some of his most effortless editing since Inception. And like Inception, as layer after layer of Dunkirk?s nesting doll structure is uncovered, and when the three stories finally converge after almost two hours of merciless tension, the emotional release is pure ecstasy.Often, in order to build this tension, the experimental work of genius that it is, Dunkirk spends long stretches in silence. DP Hoyte van Hoytema?s IMAX camera, taking a break from soaring across the skies, wrestling for space among thousands of men, and gazing placidly at the sheer beauty of it all, brings the actors? faces inches from its own. And these fine performers ? mostly young stars (Harry Styles included) ? convey wordlessly the torment raging in their characters? minds.But because of these periods of silence, and because of Nolan?s refusal to rely on words (or, for that matter, a traditional structure) to tell his story, Hans Zimmer?s terrific score becomes crucial, and slowly, emerges as a character in its own right. Like the film, it is unrelentingly intense, stretched to breaking point as it conjures tension seemingly from nothing.And such is Nolan?s power at commanding the attention of his audience, that you find yourself overlooking basic flaws. There isn?t a single character in this film that is properly fleshed out, and it fails miserably at the Bechdel Test. But never have these glaring missteps mattered less.Do you remember what Bruce Wayne said at the end of The Dark Knight Rises? Moments before flying into certain death, he looked at Commissioner Gordon, and growled, ?A hero can be anyone.?And this is the sentiment that Nolan has carried into Dunkirk. These characters aren?t meant to have elaborate backstories or complicated motivations. They?re meant to represent an ideal. They?re meant to embody our bravery and our empathy and our kindness.A hero can be anyone, from a middle-aged sailor who just wants to teach his son to do the right thing, to a decorated commander who refuses to leave until every last man who serves under him ? or even if he doesn?t ? has been saved.Dunkirk is one of the greatest war movies ever made ? it?s certainly the tightest, most unwaveringly propulsive film of Christopher Nolan?s career. But it?s also as meditative as The Thin Red Line, as brutal as Saving Private Ryan, and sometimes, even as surreal as Apocalypse Now.It deserves to be seen big and loud.Watch the Dunkirk trailer hereFollow @htshowbiz for moreThe author tweets @RohanNaahar",84,"Director Christopher Nolan's film Dunkirk which released on Friday, ""is one of the greatest war movies ever made,"" wrote Hindustan Times.

India has accused Pakistan of supporting militants, who infiltrate from the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir into the Valley and target Indian security forces. One such attack in September last year killed 18 Indian soldiers and India retaliated with ""surgical strikes"" on terrorist launchpads in PoK. Most recently, the Pakistan Army sentenced Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav on charges of espionage after a secret trial.

ZeitZeiger used 15 genes from across human genome to predict body's internal time which, the scientists say, could be used to help diagnose and monitor sleep-related disorders and also to personalise treatments.","Washington, Feb 28 (PTI) Scientists have developed a novel computer method called ZeitZeiger that uses a sample of blood to accurately predict circadian time - the time of day according to a persons body clock. ""Our study demonstrates a method for predicting a persons internal time of day that could eventually be used to help diagnose and monitor circadian- and sleep-related disorders, and also to personalise treatments,"" said Jake Hughey from Vanderbilt University in the US. ""This is the first study to use genome-wide expression data from many individuals to develop a biomarker of the circadian clock in human blood,"" Hughey said. ""Previous efforts to monitor the circadian clock in human tissues were based on a small number of individuals and/or a small set of pre-selected genes. Our method, ZeitZeiger, uses 15 genes from across the human genome to predict circadian time,"" he said. The researchers were surprised to find that 13 out of these 15 genes were not core genes of the human circadian clock. Core genes are necessary for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. They can be compared to the gears of a mechanical watch. ""Most of the genes that were selected for ZeitZeiger seem to be outputs of the clock; that is they are not the gears controlling the clock, but the hands telling the time. ""This shows that when given data for almost every gene in the genome, the algorithm can figure out which set of genes gives the best predictions, even if they are not core clock genes,"" Hughey said. In addition to predicting circadian time, the researchers demonstrated that ZeitZeiger can also be used to show how disruptions to sleep-wake and light-dark cycles affect the circadian clock. The rhythms produced by the circadian clock differ widely between individuals at any given time of day and they are often disrupted by modern environments, for example due to shift work or reduced exposure to sunlight. Circadian dysfunction is linked to conditions such as cancer, depressive disorder and obesity. Knowledge of an individuals circadian rhythms could be used to optimise the timing of therapeutic interventions, which is known as chronotherapy.

Of the 8,591 highway liquor shops affected, 3,000 shop owners have surrendered their liquor licences. UP Excise Department said that it could generate only ?14,000 crore against a target of ?19,000 crore.","By Abhinav Pandey Lucknow, Jul 5 (PTI) The Uttar Pradesh government has incurred a loss of about Rs 5,000 crore following the Supreme Court order banning all liquor shops along national as well as state highways. Of the 8,591 highway liquor shops affected by the Supreme Court order, 2,000 are yet to be relocated while 3,000 shop owners have surrendered their liquor licences, said UP Excise Minister Jai Pratap Singh. ""We have incurred a loss of about Rs 5,000 crore in 2016-17 fiscal ending March 31. Out of the target of realising Rs 19,000 crore, the excise department could generate Rs 14,000 crore following the apex court order order,"" the minister told PTI. The Supreme Court had last year ordered a ban on all liquor shops along national as well as state highways across the country and prohibited all signages indicating presence of liquor vends. The Supreme Court again on March 31 reiterated its December 15, 2016 order to shut down, by April 1, establishments selling and serving liquor within 500 metres of national and state highways, but relaxed the distance to 220 m for cities, towns and municipal areas with a population of 20,000 or less. According to latest data compiled by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), accidents due to drunk driving have the highest fatality rate among all accidents. NCRB data showed that some 42 per cent of drunk driving victims ended up dead in 2015 ? this was a far higher rate than that of accidents caused by over speeding and reckless driving. Highlighting his departments initiatives for going cashless, Singh said, ""We are introducing a cashless system in liquor shops and asking them to install point-of-sale (POS) machines. Though it will difficult in rural areas, we are asking shops to switch over to cashless payments."" On media reports suggesting that the cashless system is being introduced to deter teenagers from purchasing liquor, the minister said there is already a law which does not allow sale of liquor to minors. About sale of liquor near religious places and schools, he said, ""An SC order in 2008 says no to liquor vending with a radius of 75 metre of a school or religious place. But, with increase in population density, the number of schools and hospitals have increased leading to conflicts."" ""We have decided that no liquor shop will be relocated within 500 metre of religious places or hospitals. In case of objection, even residential colonies will come under the ambit. At the moment it is not in a very formal shape. But we are working on it,"" the minister said. About excise revenue expectations for 2017-18, the minister said his department has fixed a target of Rs 20,000 crore. The minister said that Yogi Adityanath government will introduce its new excise policy from April 2018 and the government plans to break the syndicate system in liquor trade. ""We are working on the new excise policy before finalising it,"" he said. The new excise policy may introduce a system of bar code on each bottle in a bid to check black marketing and pilferage in liquor sale, mostly in country-made alcohol products.

Its pilots mistakenly descended towards a taxiway, where four planes were parked, instead of the runway before aborting the landing. Investigators said the incident came within a few feet of becoming one of the worst aviation disasters.","Newly released data and photos show how shockingly low an Air Canada jet was when it pulled up to avoid crashing into planes waiting on a San Francisco international airport taxiway last month. The Air Canada pilots mistook the taxiway for the runway next to it and flew their jet to just 59ft (18m) above ground before pulling up to attempt another landing, according to National Transportation Safety Board information released on Wednesday.That?s barely taller than the four planes that were on the taxiway when the incident occurred late at night on 7 July. Pilots in a United plane alerted air traffic controllers about the off-course jet, while the crew of a Philippine Airlines jet behind it switched on their plane?s landing lights in an apparent last-ditch danger signal to Air Canada. NTSB investigators said they have not determined probable cause for the incident that came within a few feet of becoming one of the worst disasters in aviation history.?It was close, much too close,? said John Cox, a safety consultant and retired airline pilot.The investigators said that as the Air Canada jet approached the taxiway just before midnight after a flight from Toronto, it was so far off course that it did not appear on a radar system used to prevent runway collisions.Those systems were not designed to spot planes that are lined up to land on a taxiway a rare occurrence, especially for airline pilots. But the Federal Aviation Administration is working on modifications so they can, agency spokesman Ian Gregor said.Both pilots of the Air Canada Airbus A320 jet were very experienced. The captain, who was flying the plane, had more than 20,000 hours of flying time, and the co-pilot had about 10,000 hours.The pilots told investigators ?that they did not recall seeing aircraft on taxiway but that something did not look right to them,? the NTSB said.Investigators could not hear what the Air Canada captain and co-pilot said to each other during the aborted landing because their conversation was recorded over when the plane made other flights, starting with a San Francisco-to-Montreal trip the next morning. Recorders are required to capture only the last two hours of a plane?s flying time.Peter Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for Air Canada, declined to comment, citing the investigation.

192,"British F1 driver Lewis Hamilton gave up on a third place finish at the Hungarian Grand Prix to let his teammate Valtteri Bottas finish third instead. Hamilton, who was fourth placed, asked Mercedes to tell Bottas to let him through to chase down the leading Ferraris, agreeing to give the third place back if he fails to overtake them.","The Hungarian Grand Prix could yet stand as one of the defining moments of the 2017 Formula One season.Under the unyielding sun of a Budapest summer the two title protagonists, who have been equally unforgiving on track in a battle that has swayed gloriously between them, finally showed their hands as to how that fight would proceed in the second half of the season.Sebastian Vettel won what was hardly a classic race but Lewis Hamilton, in standing by his team-mate, admitted he might have dropped points that could ultimately cost him the world championship.Vettel won at the Hungaroring with an impressive drive from pole position. That he did so while nursing a damaged steering wheel made it all the more of an achievement but also put the Scuderia on the spot.His team-mate Kimi Raikkonen was quicker on track but they chose not to order Vettel to allow him to pass. That the German is their only title contender could not have been clearer.In their wake Hamilton was on a charge and in turn faster than his team?mate Valtteri Bottas. With passing at the Hungaroring all but impossible this year, he asked Mercedes to tell Bottas to let him through to chase down the leading Ferraris, agreeing that he would give the place back should he fail to overtake them. Bottas let him through and, unable to pass Raikkonen and seven seconds up the road from his team-mate, Hamilton duly gave back the place on the final lap. Raikkonen held second, with Bottas in third and Hamilton fourth.The British driver now trails Vettel by 14 points in the world championship and ceding the place cost him three. With the title fight likely to go to the wire it might yet prove to have been the sportsmanlike gesture that could deny him a fourth drivers? title this year.?I want to win the championship the right way,? he said. ?I don?t know whether that will come back to bite me on the backside or not but I said at the beginning of the year, I want to win it the right way. I do think today was the right way to do things.?Ferrari have a long history of imposing team orders and designating a No1 driver but the Mercedes executive director, Toto Wolff, agreed with Hamilton and drew a stark comparison with how his team and the Scuderia went racing.?We have seen the backlash from decisions that were ruthless and cold blooded and the effect that it had on the brand,? he said. ?You could say: ?Screw it, it still won them the championship, who cares? They are in the history books.? But I do not think that is the right spin and if the purpose of us being here is to do the right things and win in the right way ? sometimes doing it the right way and standing by your values is tough and it was today, believe me.?Giving the place back was no easy feat. Bottas was only just in front of the Red Bull of Max Verstappen and there was a real danger the manoeuvre could have cost Hamilton two places. The team had debated whether it should be done but were clear Hamilton was not instructed to do so and that he was merely sticking to his word.?It was very sportsmanlike behaviour,? said Wolff, who also acknowledged that it could cost Hamilton the title. ?These values won us six championships and it will make us win more championships in years to come. It cost us three points and could cost us the championship and we are perfectly conscious of that. But in terms of how the drivers and this team operates, we stick to what we say and if the consequences are as much as losing the championship, then we will take it.?There was little doubt that Vettel deserved the 25 points, both he and Raikkonen having a pace advantage in the early stage over Mercedes. But he revealed he was wrestling with his damaged car from the off. ?I felt there was something not right on the grid and for the formation lap the steering wheel was not straight,? he said.?Then it got worse and towards the end of the stint it was more difficult. We spoke on the radio about it and I was told to avoid the kerbs but on this track you use them on every corner, so you lose speed. It was good that it is tricky to overtake here. It felt like a very long race.?Ferrari have not won the constructors? championship since 2008 and have not taken the drivers? title since Raikkonen claimed it in 2007. Their step forward to go head-to head with Mercedes this season gives them a real opportunity to end the drought.Raikkonen might have been passed by Hamilton, which would have cost them constructor points, but they opted to gamble on the British driver being unable to do so. It paid off and they can consider their strategy a success but it indicated that they were willing to risk the team championship in favour of backing Vettel for the title.Maurizio Arrivabene, Ferrari?s team principal, praised Raikkonen for being a ?true team player? and Sergio Marchionne, the Ferrari chief executive, admitted the result had come as a relief. ?It was a much?needed win,? he said. ?The great thing is we earned it, this was a tough, tough race and we almost lost it and we got it back.?Vettel holds the lead going into the summer break and he has earned it but Hamilton can also rest easy knowing that he held an honourable line in Hungary. ?The team were in a difficult position but I think today really shows, hopefully, that I am a man of my word,? he said.",56,"British F1 driver Lewis Hamilton gave up on a third place finish at the Hungarian Grand Prix to let his teammate Valtteri Bottas finish third instead.

The movie hit a roadblock with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) soon after Ekta came onboard as a distributor but it only strengthened her desire to take the movie to the masses. ""The film made me angry. I saw the film and realised we really live in a world where as women we are not allowed to do or say anything. Here was this entertaining movie that spoke about what I think. Why didnt I think of it? I loved it,"" Ekta, 42, told PTI in an interview. She came onboard the project when it had already hit a roadblock. Jha called her to watch the film and asked whether she would like to distribute and she immediately agreed. ""I decided to distribute this movie knowing that I might not earn profits. Then I was hoping we would get a certificate and thats when it landed into a soup with the censor board."" The board was criticised for being regressive by refusing certification to Lipstick... as the film was ""lady- oriented"". The makers approached the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT), which directed the CBFC to certify the film with few cuts. After the film was cleared for release, Ektas team came up with an edgy poster of the film, which depicts a woman showing her middle finger. ""I thought, will this be an artie movie that 200 people will watch or a film where Ill get more and more women to see it?

Jared Kushner, husband of Trump?s daughter Ivanka and now a senior White House adviser.The formatting of the emails suggests that Trump Jr forwarded the whole chain to Manafort and Kushner before the meeting the three attended with Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in New York on 9 June.On Sunday, Trump Jr had said he had asked Manafort and Kushner to attend but not told them what the meeting was about. An associate of Manafort said on Tuesday that the former campaign chairman claims not to have read to the bottom of the chain of emails forwarded to him and Kushner by Trump Jr about the meeting. Jamie Gorelick, an attorney for Jared Kushner, did not respond to questions about whether Kushner read the emails and why he attended the meeting.Critics seized on the new disclosures to question why three of Trump?s closest advisers were willing to accept such a meeting instead of alerting authorities to interference by a foreign adversary. Special counsel Robert Mueller and the House and Senate intelligence committees are investigating Russian meddling in the election, thought to include stealing Democratic National Committee emails and the use of social-media bots to spread fake news about Clinton.My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency.Trump Jr has offered shifting explanations for the meeting in recent days. In an interview broadcast on conservative Fox News on Tuesday night, he again sought to justify his motives but conceded that he could have handled the situation better.?In retrospect I probably would have done things a little differently,? he told interviewer Sean Hannity. ?Again this is before the Russia mania, this is before they were building this up in the press.Trump Jr denied that he told his father about the meeting. ?It was just a nothing,? he added. ?There was nothing to tell. I mean, I wouldn?t have even remembered it until you started scouring through this stuff. It was literally just a wasted 20 minutes, which was a shame.?Trump spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders read a short statement from the president at the regular White House press briefing. ?My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency.?She then refused to answer several questions on the matter, saying they must be directed to Trump Jr?s legal counsel and outside counsel.Asked about the president?s reaction to the unfolding drama, Huckabee Sanders replied: ?I think the president is, I would say, frustrated with the process, the fact this continues to be an issue and he would love for us to be focused on issues like the economy, healthcare, tax reform, infrastructure.?Clinton?s running mate Tim Kaine, a senator from Virginia and member of the foreign relations committee, told MSNBC: ?These emails are explosive. This should have set off alarm bells and red lights, and yet what it seemed to do is activate their salivatory glands. This is just wheelbarrows of new evidence for the special counsel and the Senate intelligence committee.?Trump Jr released the email chain on Tuesday apparently to pre-empt its publication by the New York Times, which, this weekend, first broke the news of his meeting with Veselnitskaya in June last year. Veselnitskaya had promised compromising information about Clinton but apparently failed to deliver.In a statement posted to Twitter, Trump Jr explained: ?To everyone, in order to be totally transparent, I am releasing the entire email chain of my emails with Rob Goldstone about the meeting on June 9, 2016. To put this in context, this occurred before the current Russian fever was in vogue.?There is no such position as crown prosecutor of Russia, but the most likely candidate would be the long-serving prosecutor general, and a long-standing member of Vladimir Putin?s elite, Yuri Chaika.Goldstone told the Wall Street Journal his reference to the ?crown prosecutor? was meant to mean Veselnitskaya. ?It?s a language thing,? he said. He referred questions from the Guardian to his lawyer.Trump Jr has given varying reasons for why he accepted the meeting, first claiming it was to discuss American adoptions of Russian children, then acknowledging that he was interested in information about Clinton.The president?s eldest son denies any wrongdoing and tweeted on Tuesday: ?Media and Dems are extremely invested in the Russia story. If this nonsense meeting is all they have after a year, I understand the desperation!?Goldstone told the Associated Press on Monday he set up the meeting on behalf of a client, pop star Emin Agalarov, the son of a Moscow-based developer, Aras Agalarov, who has close ties to Putin and tried to partner with Trump in a hotel project.Aras Agalarov worked with Donald Trump to bring the Miss Universe contest to Moscow in 2013. Trump appeared in a music video with Emin Agalarov that featured several Miss Universe contestants.Goldstone?s 3 June email says the Russian government?s support for Trump is ?helped along by Aras and Emin?. He asks if Trump Jr wants to speak to Emin about it directly and proposes: ?I can also send this info to your father via Rhona? ? presumably Rhona Graff, Donald Trump?s longtime executive assistant ? ?but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first.? It is not clear from the emails whether Goldstone did send any of the information to Trump Sr, who has denied all knowledge of the meeting through his lawyer. Before the publication of Trump Jr?s emails, Veselnitskaya had denied she had gone to the meeting with information about the Clinton campaign. ?It?s quite possible that maybe they were looking for such information, they wanted it so badly,? she told NBC, denying that she had any to offer. She also answered ?no? when asked if she had ever worked for the Russian government.Later, Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the US, dismissed the significance of the Trump Jr meeting. ?I don?t think anything about it and to be honest there are more serious things to be think about in relation to Russia,? he told the Guardian at a US-Russia Business Council farewell reception in Washington.Trump Jr was at Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday, according to a police officer at the building.Eric Trump, Donald Jr?s brother, was spotted in the lobby at around 1.30pm with his wife Lara. Asked by the Guardian if he had any comment on his brother?s emails or knew Goldstone himself, Eric Trump did not respond. He then headed quickly to a gold elevator and headed upwards, staring silently ahead.The revelations around 39-year-old Trump Jr?s involvement is one of the biggest blows yet in the saga of the Trump campaign?s alleged ties to Russia, which the president has dismissed as a ?hoax?.Republicans on Capitol Hill were taken aback but reluctant to weigh in just yet. At least two Republicans on the Senate intelligence committee, Senators John Cornyn and James Lankford, said Trump Jr should testify before the panel, which is overseeing one of three parallel investigations into Russian interference in the US election.John McCain, a frequent critic of the Trump administration, said there were ?many allusions and many stories of meetings and communications?, while noting he expected there was more yet to come.Richard Burr, the Republican chief of the Senate intelligence committee, said it was ?too early to draw any conclusions?.Burr?s Democratic counterpart, Mark Warner, said it was significant that the emails had been forwarded to Kushner and Manafort.?They?ve got a lot of explaining to do, because all these denials of any knowledge of Russian government involvement seems to be a gross contradiction here,? Warner told Roll Call.Some of Trump?s most ardent defenders nonetheless stood by the president. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who competed bitterly against Trump for the Republican nomination, blamed the media for fixating on Russia.?Russia is a significant adversary,? he told reporters. ?Part of the irony of this media obsession with Russia is that the Obama administration began with Hillary Clinton bringing the big reset button with Russia.Norm Eisen, former ethics czar under President Barack Obama, said: ?It?s another significant step forward in the investigation of Trump collusion with Russia because it represents an offer to collude and an acceptance of collusion to harm the campaign of Hillary Clinton and intrude upon our democracy.?He added: ?I believe it?s potentially legally actionable but we need to let the investigation play out. I predict it will not be the last bombshell.?Additional reporting by Shaun Walker in Moscow and Oliver Laughland and Jon Swaine in New YorkHere's my statement and the full email chain pic.twitter.com/x050r5n5LQHere is page 4 (which did not post due to space constraints). pic.twitter.com/z1Xi4nr2gq",102,"US President Donald Trump's son Donald Trump Jr on Tuesday released emails showing he was offered ""sensitive"" information on Hillary Clinton by a Russian lawyer before the US presidential elections.

What a strange day. Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic have both hobbled out of the tournament and it?s the first time since 2005 that only one member of the Big Four has made it to the Wimbledon semis. That man?s Roger Federer. He?s through to play Tomas Berdych on Friday. The other semi will be contested by Marin Cilic and Sam Querrey. It?s Federer?s to lose, but it?s time to expect the unexpected. That?s all from me today. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye.Novak Djokovic, in Serbian: ""maybe i will miss half a year playing.""

Djokovic is the 10th player to retire. ?We?ve had a very long, very tough year with a lot of matches. Bodies have taken a lot physically. As an athlete, one way or another you are going to experience this kind of thing. Injuries are part of sport.?

6.31pm BST
18:31

Djokovic continues. ?The intensity and level of pain was increasing as the days went by. I was feeling it since the beginning of the tournament. I kept doing everything with my physiotherapist. It was only getting worse. Today was the worst day. Probably the fact I played yesterday, days adding up, it wasn?t helping. I?m not a specialist but I?m going to speak with some and understand what needs to be done. I haven?t considered not starting. I always like to give it a shot and step on the court. That?s all I could do.?

Djokovic says he will talk with specialists to see how he can solve the problem. He says he needs to rest.

Was it challenging to play back-to-back days? ?Those kind of circumstances don?t really help. At the end of the day it?s the kind of situation you have to accept. I spent two hours on the table. It wasn?t to be. For an athlete there is no way out if you don?t feel fit.? 

6.27pm BST
18:27

Novak Djokovic speaks. ?It?s not the shoulder, it?s the elbow that keeps bothering me. For over a year and a half actually. It?s unfortunate I have to finish Wimbledon in this way. I was able for 30 minutes to play with some pain that was bearable. All the treatments and medication couldn?t help. The serves and forehands were where I could feel it the most and after that there was really no point.?

Well, who?d have thought that only one member of the Big Four would still be standing at the end of play on the second Wednesday? That decision to skip the French Open by Federer doesn?t look too bad now.

If this is Mark Knowles? work, I?d say his tenure is going to be short.?Raonic has had a few injury problems this year, so perhaps he?s not at full pelt. Still, he?s dropping his forehands very short today and that?s asking for it against Federer, who?s giving it the treatment.

""As such the CRPF is stretched. Then is the additional responsibility of ongoing elections,"" the 1981 batch IPS officer said. He instead visited the troops and tried to address their concerns, Prasad added.","A step to ease some pressure from a vast body of stressed troops has been taken.In what many have termed an 'unprecedented departure from an age-old norm', the Director General of the India's biggest central armed police force, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), K Durga Prasad has declined a farewell parade being planned for his retirement at the end of the month. This is, in his own words, keeping the 'convenience of the force in mind'.From being deployed for the conduct of elections to supporting counter-insurgency operations to aiding the police, the 239-battalion strong CRPF is among the most extensively deployed forces.WHY NO FAREWELL PARADEIn his first reaction, K Durga Prasad, a 1981 batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer said, ""As such the CRPF is stretched. Then is the additional responsibility of ongoing elections. In this, a farewell parade would have meant that my personnel would be committed for an extended period to duties which are ceremonial in nature"". Instead, ""I visited my troops where they are, heard them and am trying to address their issues"", he said. Travelling over weekends, clearing files till late in the evening in office and camping for night halts between troop locations is indeed a norm for the present DG. He asked his staff to arrange a simple Guard of Honour to mark the end of his career.  Durga Prasad enjoys the reputation of being a hands-on leader with his ear to the ground. From taking the Maoists head-on in united Andhra Pradesh as the leader of 'Greyhounds' force, he also held charge of the elite Special Protection Group (SPG) between November 2011 and November 2014. He also, as the Inspector General (IG), played a role in raising CRPF's own commando force, CoBRA (Commando Battalion for Resolute Action). His choice, to many, reflects an acknowledgement of something being amiss.Also read | Exclusive: CRPF working on mobile app for its 3 lakh jawans   A uniformed force functions on the principle of alternative posting for its personnel. From areas considered 'hard', personnel should be posted to areas considered 'soft'. This so that adequate rest, recuperation and training can be provided. However, forces like the CRPF have almost junked this principle. Rest, recuperation and training have been reduced merely to concepts on paper, say insiders. ""From a 50 per cent divide into hard and soft areas, the CRPF is more than 80 per cent into hard areas. Where is the room for respite?"", asked an informed source. DURGA PRASAD'S MOVE WELCOMEDAn officer of the CRPF, who has previously organised farewell parades termed Durga Prasad's decision a 'welcome move'. He recounted, ""For about a month, nearly 1,000 troops pooled in from all across the country march up and down in practice for the farewell parade at the CRPF training academy near Gurugram. In comparison, a Guard of Honour will involve not more than 100 troops"". DC Dey is a highly-regarded veteran, who retired as the Additional Director General of the CRPF. In his opinion, Durga Prasad's move deserves to be 'commended'. ""Someone retiring as a DG definitely deserves a show. However, very few outside have an idea of how much stress the force personnel are under. When elections are around the corner, we cancel all leaves"".",30,"In a bid to avoid additional pressure on the troops, outgoing CRPF Director General K Durga Prasad has refused the ceremonial farewell parade planned for his retirement.

						?We are taking suo motu cognisance of the matter and sending him a letter asking him to apologise or retract his statement,? Kumaramangalam said.The actor, speaking to the media on Wednesday, had named the actress while answering a question on the security of women in the film industry. ?Why is it the safety of women in the film industry alone? A female?s presence in the crowd is important to me and I will not let anything happen to her. It?s our duty to see if you are safe. It is not just about actresses. We are not supporting her (mentions the name), because she is an actress,? he said.When it was pointed out that sexual assault victims should not be identified, he said, ?It doesn?t matter if I have used the name. You have put out her name everywhere. Do not hide the name as there is nothing wrong with it. If you want to call her Draupadi, call her Draupadi.

Section 228 A of the Indian Penal Code bans the disclosure of the identity of victims of certain offences, including sexual assault, barring specified circumstances.Violation of this can be punished with a fine or imprisonment which may extend to two years. ?He (Kamal Haasan) can?t be booked by us but someone else like the victim herself or fans can lodge a protest. The police can do it on their own also. When someone like him who has billions of fans says something like this, it sets a bad precedent,? said Kumaramangalam.The NCW chief also said all that the actor had to do was apologise.?If he has made a mistake it won?t make him small to say that ?I am sorry?. In fact, he doesn?t even need to use the word ?sorry? -- he could just say, ?I didn?t mean to say it?.

","An International-level discus thrower, who had bagged two medals for the country, was among three persons arrested from New Delhi railway station with more than 25 kilos of Mephedrone drug (popularly known as meow-meow in party circles), police said on Friday. The estimated worth of the drugs seized from the accused is around Rs 50 crore.The discus thrower, identified as Harpreet Singh, won a silver medal at the 2004 Commonwealth Youth Games in Australia and a bronze at the 2006 South Asian Games, before a foot injury cut his career short. ?Harpreet?s career was marred with doping charges that had once also fetched him a six-month long ban,? Sanjeev Yadav, DCP (special cell) said.The other two arrested men were identified as athlete Amandeep Singh, who was pursuing a diploma in hospitality and tourism in London, and Hanish Sarpal who had enrolled in a management course at a university in London, but later dropped out.Harpreet and Amandeep were nabbed by a special cell team from New Delhi station on Wednesday evening, after the police were informed that the duo would be smuggling meow-meow drugs from Mumbai to the capital.Police said 25 kilos of Mephedrone was seized from the possession of the accused. Mephedrone is popular in parties and is used as a substitute for cocaine. Wednesday?s recovery was possibly the biggest seizure of the drugs from the national capital, police said.An officer said the interrogation of the duo led the police to Hanish, who was nabbed from west Delhi?s Janakpuri with another 650 grams of the same drug.

A foot injury that he picked up before the Commonwealth squad selection ensured that he didn?t make the cut, said the officer.

But it was Rawat who saved the day for India by scoring a 50 break just when they had a deficit of a similar margin.But a critical miss on the pink before starting with the colours, brought Masih back to the table, gifting him a regulation clearance of yellow to black.

A complaint has been filed with the Animal Welfare Board of India, who have written to the Punjab Police.","Popular Punjabi singers Diljit Dosanjh and Kamal Grewal may find themselves in trouble for 'glorifying dog fights' in their latest album videos and songs.Animal rights activists have set up a page on Facebook called 'Exposing Animal Fights in India', whereby they have uploaded more than 100 secretly-captured videos of the 'canine blood sport.'This sport is hugely popular in parts of Punjab and Haryana such as Bhatinda, Ludhiana, Hisar, Fatehabad, Gurgaon and held clandestinely in several farmhouses in Delhi. Breeds such as pittbulls, bull dogs, Indian mastiffs and other pedigree dogs are especially bred and trained to be ferocious to the point of being lethal and kill other dogs in wrestling-kind of rings.Alongside, the dog lovers have also uploaded a song each of Diljit Dosanjh called 'Pitbull' and Kamal Grewal's 'Sarkari Ban' where both seem to be promoting the illegal activity.While Dosanjh, who is himself seen handling pitbulls in the video, says, ""Rakhe fight nu vi Pitbull chaar ni"" (Have kept four pitbulls for fighting), Grewal in his song called 'Sarkari Ban' says, ""Petbull'an da chalaya yaaran ne hai daur ni"" (Friends have begun the trend of pitbull fighting).""

It is wrong to project dog fights as something macho, valiant or courageous. Punjab has historically been known for healthy human sports like kushti and kabaddi.

Strangely, singer Kamal Grewal responded to one of these FB posts saying, ""How can a song, which is itself named 'Sarkari Ban' be banned by the authorities."" Diljit Dosanjh, on the other hand, did not respond to the criticism on FB despite being tagged.Earlier, Union minister for women and child welfare Maneka Gandhi had said that she was aware of this cruel sport.

In October 2014, former SAP board member Vishal Sikka took over as CEO. Murthy, by then, was serving a second stint at Infosys as Chairman. While he was appointed as Chairman Emeritus with effect from October 11, 2014, Murthy turned down the offer. However, over the last few months, Murthy has been very vocal in criticising Infosys management on a slew of issues, including alleged lapses in corporate governance, CEO salary package and severance pay to former employees. In the interview, the IT veteran termed the listing of the country's second largest software services firm on Nasdaq as his biggest success story. ""I think sitting on those high stools at Nasdaq when we got listed, when we became the first Indian company to be listed on Nasdaq, and borrowing the words of Neil Armstrong to say that it is a small step for Nasdaq, but a giant leap for Infosys and the Indian software industry. I think that was the best,"" he said.

The police said that Ilyas is a resident of Muzaffarnagar, where he owns and runs a grocery shop that he also uses as a front to sell arms to ?regular customers?.?The accused brought the weapons and cartridges, which we found were manufactured at an illegal arms factory owned by one Mobin, who is also a co-accused in the case. Mobin had told Ilyas to deliver the arms to a contact in Ghaziabad and was to give him the identity of the contact once he reached Ghaziabad,? Manish Mishra, the assistant superintendent of police, said.However, before Mobin could give him the information, the police nabbed Ilyas along with the cache of illegal weapons. Officers said that the bigger weapons are generally sold for Rs20,000 apiece while the smaller ones, shaped like pistols, are sold for Rs10,000 each. Sources said that illegal countrymade pistols are generally manufactured from spare parts of trucks, especially, the lower end of the steering gear, which are shaped into barrels as they are strong and can withstand the firepower. The illegal weapons are then shaped by the manufacturers with the help of heat generated in a furnace.There have been several instances wherein the police have nabbed arms suppliers in Ghaziabad.In April, the police arrested a man who was carrying 12 pistols and 11 magazines, and had come to Ghaziabad from Muzaffarnagar to deliver weapons.In January, the Ghaziabad police arrested two persons from Shatabdipuram and recovered three illegal pistols and 600 semi-built magazines (used to store cartridges in weapons) from their possession.?Ilyas has also been to jail earlier in connection with supplying and manufacturing arms.

","Struggling to find people willing to work as monkey catchers, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to hire them on contract. At present, the civic agency has only one staff for catching and relocating hundreds of monkeys roaming in 104 wards. Due to manpower shortage, it could catch only 15 monkeys in the last one year, said an SDMC official. Now, the corporation proposes to pay them a regular salary, even if they don?t catch any monkey. So far, SDMC pays Rs1,200 for catching and relocation of one monkey.?We are waiting for the financial approval and possibly by next week we will start the tendering process for hiring monkey catchers at a monthly salary of ?18,000. That?s the last thing we can do to attract monkey catchers,? said a senior SDMC official. For the past three years, the corporation has written letters to the state governments asking for help in procuring services of monkey catchers. ?We wrote to different states corporations such as Haryana, UP, HP and Andhra Pradesh for providing monkey catchers but failed to get any reply,? said RBS Tyagi, director veterinary department, SDMC.According to him, there are multiple reasons responsible for existing shortage of workforce.?The monkeys are protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. They are looked after by the wildlife department after they?re relocated at the Asola Bhatti Mines Sanctuary. So ideally it should be the department?s responsibility to catch the monkeys,? said Tyagi.The SDMC claimed it shared the facts with the wildlife department and but didn?t get any reply. ?Except for Rajasthan, no other state corporations are catching monkeys,? said a senior SDMC official. SDMC will soon file an affidavit in the Delhi high court, asking that the responsibility of catching and relocating monkeys be shifted to the Delhi government?s wildlife department.Officials said that the monkeys that are relocated to the forest of Asola Bhatti mines are coming back to the residential areas in search of food. ?We have received complaints from neighbouring schools, dispensaries and residential areas about simians coming in groups to steal food from people?s houses and attack them. But we are helpless,? said a senior official. Besides, the animal lovers also add to the problem by filing police complaints against corporations and monkey catchers when the simians are caught in ones and twos, not troops.?Such an incident happened in Nizamuddin and our staff was harassed unnecessarily.

Alleging that Infosys board was ""misguided"", Pai said the """"fundamental problem"" was the pay hike given earlier to CEO Vishal Sikka ""without any justification"", because of which other executives were also expecting higher pay. He said salary levels in India cannot be compared with that in the US. ""I totally agree with Murthy that it was not proper. We should have Indian norm for compensation; we cant follow American norm, we (Infosys) are not an American company,"" Pai, who was also formerly Chief Finance Officer of Infosys, told PTI in a telephonic interview. The comments come at a time when a row has erupted again between some founders and the current management of the firm. Pai argued that at a time when the salary for entry level software engineers had not been raised in the IT industry in India for the past seven years, it is totally wrong to hike the compensation for top-level executives. ""The starting salary for software engineers has not gone up for the past seven years; and the inflation in the last seven years is about 60 per cent,"" he said. The salary of Chief Operating Officer (of Infosys) three-four years ago was Rs 3.5 crore or Rs 4 crore. Now, it has gone up to Rs 12 crore, according to the Chairman of Manipal Global Education Services and Aarin Capital. ""I think unless people at the bottom (software engineers) get good, regular hike, paying people at the top for doing nothing...for long period of time is totally wrong,"" Pai said. Without naming Rao, he said, ""That too we have been paying (compensation hike) for a person who has been in the company for 30 years."" ""If somebody has done spectacularly well, then its okay. Performance is not spectacular. Salary is spectacular,"" he said. ""I think the Board was misguided. You hired a CEO (Vishal Sikka). You are forced by the CEO to increase (his) salary from USD 7 million to 11 million. There was no justification,"" he said. ""When you see CEO getting so much, then COO will say: what about me? I cannot be paid one-tenth of what CEO is being paid,"" he said. ""The fundamental error was increasing CEOs salary from USD 7 million to 11 million without any justification,"" Pai further said. Raising the CEOs salary was the ""fundamental problem,"" and it could now lead to top-level executives and executive committee members seeking a pay hike, he said.

The cop was arrested by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) for taking money from a woman whose husband was held in connection with drug trafficking.

The woman was shocked to hear what Charan wanted in return of release of her husband.Apart from Rs 2 lakh, the policeman wanted the woman to sleep with him. The woman somehow managed Rs 1 lakh and gave it to Kamaldan Charan. She also gave him a cheque of Rs 1 lakh as guarantee. But the Charan insisted on cash. When the woman expressed her inability in providing him with the money, the 'predator' cop asked her to 'compromise' if she wanted her man to be free.Charan told the woman that he will come at her house in night to 'enjoy' and spend some time with her. Stunned by what she heard, the woman immediately approached the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). After verifying the facts, ACB sleuths laid a trap to nab Kamaldan Charan red handed. HOW THE PERVERT COP WAS ARRESTEDCharan told the woman he would visit her on Tuesday night when is out on patrolling duty. The ACB was informed about this. He reached the woman's house on time and bolted the doors from inside. Before he could proceed according to his plan, the door bell rang. Charan's game was over.

451,"Israel has removed metal detectors from the entrance of Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque following days of violent protests over the installation. The move is aimed at ending the crisis which claimed seven lives, Israeli officials said. The Palestinians reportedly see the installation of metal detectors as an Israeli attempt to assert control over the holy site.","Israel is removing metal detectors from entrances to the compound that houses al-Aqsa mosque.The move was announced late on Monday night by the office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and is designed to end a crisis over the holy site. Days of violent confrontations have claimed seven lives.Despite the Israeli announcement, however, a senior Muslim cleric in Jerusalem said worshippers should stay away from the shrine pending a review of the new Israeli security arrangements there.Ikrema Sabri, the head of the Supreme Islamic Committee in the city, said such a review may be completed later on Tuesday. Sabri said: ?Our position is that for now, nobody should enter? the shrine.The removal of the detectors on Tuesday appeared to be part of a deal under which Israeli diplomats were repatriated from Jordan, including an embassy security guard who was involved in a fatal shooting of two Jordanians on Sunday night.The brief statement said the Israeli security cabinet, which met on Monday evening, had ?accepted the recommendation of all of the security bodies to incorporate security measures based on advanced technologies (?smart checks?) and other measures instead of metal detectors in order to ensure the security of visitors and worshippers in the Old City and on the Temple Mount?.The statement added that under the plan Israeli police would ?reinforce? their presence around the holy site. It did not say when the metal detectors would be removed or what would replace them. Israeli media earlier reported that high-resolution cameras capable of detecting hidden objects would be the alternative.Earlier on Monday the UN?s Middle East envoy warned of the dangers of allowing the crisis to continue. ?It is extremely important that a solution to the current crisis be found by Friday this week,? Nickolay Mladenov said after briefing the UN security council. ?The dangers on the ground will escalate if we go through another cycle of Friday prayer without a resolution.? He said events in east Jerusalem were not ?localised? but ?affect millions if not billions of people around the world?.Even before the Israeli decision to remove the devices, it was unclear whether such a move would be sufficient to end the violence. Muslim religious officials ? who allege Israel is trying to expand its control at the site ? said they would accept only a return to the arrangements for access to the compound that had been in place before an incident on 14 Julywhen two Israeli policemen were shot by three Israeli Arab gunmen who had smuggled weapons on to the site.?This movement is a movement of the street,? said Sheikh Raed Dana of the waqf, the Islamic endowments organisation that administers the mosque compound, commenting on whether he believed worshippers should end protests and return to the shrine. ?We as the waqf listen to the street. The street says yes and we say yes; if the street says no to the measures, we will say no.?There has been increasing criticism of the way the metal detectors were installed, without consultation with the waqf and reportedly over the objections of senior Israeli security officials who had warned of the risk of bloodshed.On Monday night Israeli diplomats were evacuated from the embassy in the Jordanian capital, Amman, after Sunday?s shooting of two Jordanians by a security guard.The diplomats, including Israel?s ambassador to Jordan, Einat Schlain, crossed the Allenby bridge border in a convoy, arriving back in Israel at around 11pm. Among those repatriated were the security guard whom Jordan had originally said it wanted to retain for questioning over the incident.A Jordanian news site linked to the kingdom?s military said investigators had determined that the altercation at the embassy compound was not politically motivated and that one of the Jordanians, a 17-year-old, had attacked the guard with a screwdriver in a dispute about a furniture delivery.Under an agreement negotiated by the head of Israel?s domestic security service, who had been sent to Amman to negotiate, Israel agreed that Jordanian police could hear the guard?s description of the incident in the presence of Israeli diplomats.Netanyahu?s office said the return of the diplomats had been made possible ?thanks to close cooperation which was held in the past day between Israel and Jordan?.",36,"Israel has removed metal detectors from the entrance of Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque following days of violent protests over the installation.

The last pet-less US leader was Andrew Johnson who was impeached in 1868. US Presidents have owned conventional pets like cats and dogs, and also exotic animals like bears and tigers.n","Politically ambitious pups and kittens: Put your resumes aside.The job of first pet ? an enviable White House gig with luxurious live-in privileges, after-hours access to the President and guaranteed positive press coverage ? is not currently available.That?s because President Donald Trump is not looking for a fluffy sidekick at the moment. Asked about plans for a four-legged addition to the White House, Stephanie Grisham, a spokesperson for Melania Trump, said in a statement: ?The first family is still getting settled so there are no plans at this time.?If Trump stays pet-free, he will be breaking with a long held tradition of presidential pet ownership.President Franklin Delano Roosevelt?s had his beloved terrier Fala. President George HW Bush?s English springer spaniel Millie was featured on ?The Simpsons.? When President Barack Obama?s family acquired their Portuguese water dog Bo, it was big news.?In the modern-day presidency, almost all of them have had a pet,? said Jennifer Pickens, a White House social expert who wrote ?Pets at the White House.? Still, she noted, ?all didn?t necessarily have them at the beginning of the administration.?Power and pets have long gone hand in hand.Read |?Hardly a dog?s life! Obama?s pets Bo and Sunny have schedules too?For some reason people in power, they end up suffocating different opinions and dominating their staff, but they in some ways long for someone who will speak up to them, and a pet will,? said Doug Wead, a former George HW Bush administration staffer who wrote books on presidential children and the 2016 campaign.Wead noted that political pets can sometimes be used for, well, politics. He recalled an event after Millie had puppies that was ?carefully choreographed so guests could see all these little puppies.?President Bush and first lady Barbara Bush walking with their dog Millie across the South Lawn as they return to the White House.

						?It was calculated like a state dinner,? he said.While there have been notable pets in the White House for generations, Millie was the first modern White House dog, said Pickens. She added that Barbara Bush was the first one to ?use the pet as a tool to reach out.?The former first lady wrote ?Millie?s Book: As Dictated to Barbara Bush,? which reached the number one spot on the New York Times non-fiction best seller list in the fall of 1990.

						During President George W Bush?s administration, when the White House was closed for tours after 9/11, the administration tried to connect with the public through videos. Among them was the ?Barney Cam? series of short videos featuring the Scottish terrier having adventures in the West Wing, with cameos from the first family and White House staff.When he declared victory in the 2008 presidential race, Barack Obama told his daughters: ?You have earned the new puppy that?s coming with us to the White House.? Several months later, Bo joined the family, a gift from the late Sen. Ted Kennedy. Bo quickly became a household name, appearing on morning television shows and in videos promoting the White House Easter egg roll.Some notable pets belonged to first kids, including Amy Carter?s Siamese cat Misty Malarky Ying Yang and Caroline Kennedy?s pony Macaroni. The Kennedy family had a veritable menagerie of pets, complete with dogs, cats, birds, hamsters and a rabbit named Zsa Zsa.Going back in White House history, some presidential pet stories get more outlandish. According to the Presidential Pet Museum website, President Martin Van Buren was given a pair of tiger cubs that he donated to a zoo and President John Quincy Adams was presented an alligator.Obama's pet dogs Bo and Sunny.

						While Trump has not embraced presidential pet ownership, vice-president Mike Pence has picked up the slack. The Pences have a bunny, Marlon Bundo, and a cat named Pickles. Another cat named Oreo recently died. And they just added two more pets to the household ? puppy Harley and cat Hazel. They also installed a beehive.Pickens said she doesn?t know that it matters if Trump gets a dog, but she said they are ?effective tools to connect with the American people and I think pets help humanise the presidency.?Of course, while pet ownership can provide personal and political perks, it can also go wrong.

","There is a  rush of students every year for admission to different Delhi University colleges which are considered the best in the country. However, none of the colleges have managed to get the highest grade in quality assessment conducted by a UGC appointed panel. The quality status score is given by the National Accredition and Assessment Council (NAAC), an autonomous body of University Grants Commission (UGC). The highest grade that the body gives is of A++, which no DU college has managed to secure in the latest rankings.Tested on parameters such as curriculum, teaching learning, evaluation, faculty research, infrastructure, learning resources, governance and student services,  only three out of the 62 colleges secured the second grade of A+.  Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC), Lady Shri Ram College for Women (LSR) and Hindu College have scored 3.65, 3.61 and 3.60 points, respectively.  To get A++ an institution has to score a grade between 3.76 to 4. ?There are certain parameters like research, consultancy and extension on which colleges are marked. But if we see research is not factored in our workload and over consultancy there is a veil of secrecy. So for colleges and universities there can?t be judged on the same set of parameters,? said a teacher at LSR on condition of anonymity.However the college whose score has taken everyone by surprise is St.Stephen?s.  The college, which has got A grade with 3.21 score, is lower than colleges such as Kirori Mal, Khalsa College, Acharya Narendra Dev College and Jesus and Mary.

It was in 2012 that UGC made accreditation compulsory for higher educational institutions and DU executive council adopted the decision in 2014. Once an institution applies for the accreditation, a peer team from NAAC visits the colleges for 3-4 days and interacts with teachers, students, alumni and all stakeholders of the institution.  ?It is a very systematic process which is comprehensive and some of which is even video recorded,? said a teacher at SRCC.

201,"Facebook has shut down one of its Artificial Intelligence systems after chatbots programmed to converse in English started speaking in their own language. Using machine learning algorithms, the bots were allowed to converse freely to strengthen their conversational skills. However, they began to deviate from the scripted norms and started speaking a new language created without human input. ","Days after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that artificial intelligence (AI) was the biggest risk, Facebook has shut down one of its AI systems after chatbots started speaking in their own language defying the codes provided.According to a report in Tech Times on Sunday, the social media giant had to pull the plug on the AI system that its researchers were working on ?because things got out of hand?. ?The AI did not start shutting down computers worldwide or something of the sort, but it stopped using English and started using a language that it created,? the report noted.Initially the AI agents used English to converse with each other but they later created a new language that only AI systems could understand, thus, defying their purpose.This led Facebook researchers to shut down the AI systems and then force them to speak to each other only in English.In June, researchers from the Facebook AI Research Lab (FAIR) found that while they were busy trying to improve chatbots, the ?dialogue agents? were creating their own language.Soon, the bots began to deviate from the scripted norms and started communicating in an entirely new language which they created without human input, media reports said.Using machine learning algorithms, the ?dialogue agents? were left to converse freely in an attempt to strengthen their conversational skills.The researchers also found these bots to be ?incredibly crafty negotiators?.?After learning to negotiate, the bots relied on machine learning and advanced strategies in an attempt to improve the outcome of these negotiations,? the report said.?Over time, the bots became quite skilled at it and even began feigning interest in one item in order to ?sacrifice? it at a later stage in the negotiation as a faux compromise,? it added.Although this appears to be a huge leap for AI, several experts including Professor Stephen Hawking have raised fears that humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, could be superseded by AI.Others like Tesla?s Elon Musk, philanthropist Bill Gates and ex-Apple founder Steve Wozniak have also expressed their concerns about where the AI technology was heading.Interestingly, this incident took place just days after a verbal spat between Facebook CEO and Musk who exchanged harsh words over a debate on the future of AI.?I?ve talked to Mark about this (AI). His understanding of the subject is limited,? Musk tweeted last week. The tweet came after Zuckerberg, during a Facebook livestream earlier this month, castigated Musk for arguing that care and regulation was needed to safeguard the future if AI becomes mainstream.?I think people who are naysayers and try to drum up these doomsday scenarios -- I just, I don?t understand it. It?s really negative and in some ways I actually think it is pretty irresponsible,? Zuckerberg said.Musk has been speaking frequently on AI and has called its progress the ?biggest risk we face as a civilisation?.?AI is a rare case where we need to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive because if we?re reactive in AI regulation it?s too late,? he said.",30,"Facebook has shut down one of its Artificial Intelligence systems after chatbots programmed to converse in English started speaking in their own language.

2893,"Google has started removing private medical records from its search results, after adjusting its policy regarding personal information. In 2016, an Indian pathology lab mistakenly leaked names and HIV blood test results of over 43,000 patients. The last change to Google's removal policy was made to cover ""revenge porn"" in which people's sexually explicit images are uploaded without their consent. ","Google has started removing private medical records from its search results, after adjusting its policy regarding personal information.The change was made on Thursday to include the ?confidential, personal medical records of private people? in the bracket of information Google may remove unprompted from search results. Other examples of such information include national or government issued identification numbers, bank account numbers, credit card numbers and images of signatures.The leaking of private medical records can be extremely damaging to the victims, both financially and emotionally, with future prospects affected and private lives of the vulnerable exposed. Given that Google?s indexing system will capture anything that?s publicly accessible on the internet, leaks such as those created by an Indian pathology lab which uploaded more than 43,000 patient records in December, including names and HIV blood test results, can be particularly damaging.The last change to the removal policy was made in 2015 with the addition of ?nude or sexually explicit images that were uploaded or shared without your consent? to cover so-called revenge porn.The new addition to Google?s scrubbing policy marks a change from the search company?s traditional hands-off, algorithmic approach which resists attempts at censorship. This has come under scrutiny over the last few years due to the spread of fake news and misinformation. Google recently adjusted its search results to down-rank contested information such as fake news.For many Google has become the gateway to the internet, meaning that removal from the company?s search results effectively scrubs them from the internet. While the information will still be accessible via other search engines or directly, other associated actions including the European right to be forgotten have seen being removed from Google?s search results as good enough to affect change.Google has recently come under fire for its search and services such as YouTube being used to spread extremist content, as well as its ad network being used to fund sites dedicated to spreading hate speech and propaganda. The company introduced new measures for YouTube to tackle the spread of terrorist material, while its head of European operations apologised after adverts for major brands appeared next to extremist material.",15,"Google has started removing private medical records from its search results, after adjusting its policy regarding personal information.

Further, IMF said that the implementation of a robust GST regime should be a key priority for the country, given its growth-enhancing effects.","From Lalit K Jha Washington, Feb 22 (PTI) The adoption of the GST could help raise Indias medium-term GDP growth to over eight per cent and create a single national market for enhancing the efficiency of the movement of goods and services, the IMF said today. At the same time, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also expressed concerns over the implementation of the Goods and Service Tax (GST). ""Although some uncertainties remain around the design and pace of implementation of the GST, its adoption is poised to help raise Indias medium-term GDP growth to above 8 per cent as it will create a single national market and enhance the efficiency of intra-Indian movement of goods and services,"" the IMF said in its annual country report on India. The IMF said larger than expected gains from the GST and further structural reforms could lead to significantly stronger growth, while a sustained period of continued low global energy prices would also be beneficial to India. Noting that Indias tax revenue-to-GDP ratio (at around 17 and a half per cent) remains considerably below than its emerging market peers, the IMF said the implementation of a robust GST should be a key priority given its growth-enhancing effects. ""The GST should have minimal exemptions, uniform cross-state rates, and as few tax rate tiers as possible,"" it said. Key production inputs, such as energy and real estate, should be kept within the tax base to enable greater output gains and reduce the tax burden across sectors, the IMF said. Rationalisation of the structure of direct taxes toward a lower corporate income tax rate with smaller and streamlined deductions and exemptions should continue, it said. Efforts to improve tax administration should be stepped up as the scope for revenue gains is large. According to the IMF report, Indian authorities were confident that the outstanding issues related to GST implementation could be settled promptly. ""The GST would provide for a significant improvement over the current indirect tax system. Tax reform priorities going forward include continuing the phased reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 30 to 25 per cent over four years, coupled with a simultaneous reduction in tax deductions,"" it said. The GST replaces a plethora of cascading center, state, interstate and local taxes with a single, nationwide, value-added tax on goods and services.

But they?re still very rare. This may be only the second complete skull found in New Mexico,? he said.After the family contacted Houde, the jaw and two pieces of tusk were taken to the Vertebrate Museum at NMSU.In May, the family joined a team of scientists who worked for about a week to carefully unearth the skull.Houde estimates the jaw weighs about 120 pounds and the entire skull as little as a tonne. While the skull may appear to be strong, it is quite delicate.?The upper part of the skull is deceiving. It?s mostly hollow and the surface of the skull is eggshell thin,? Houde said.?An extremely large skull would be very heavy for the animal if it didn?t have air inside it to lighten it up just like our own sinuses,? he said.?That makes the thing extremely fragile and the only thing holding it together is the sediment surrounding it,? he added.During the weeklong extraction process, 10 to 12 people helped at different times with the excavation of the stegomastodon skull.Researchers painstakingly brushed away the last bits of dirt from the skull and tusk and applied chemical hardeners to ensure the ancient bones remained intact.Acting like plastics, the chemicals harden and restore the strength that would otherwise be present in the bone as protein.After the skull was unearthed, the team carefully coated the fossil with plaster and placed wood braces to protect and support it.The skull was lifted from the dig site by a front-end loader and placed on a flatbed truck for the trip back to the university.While the process to study and reconstruct the skull, jaw and tusks will take years to complete, Houde said that the stegomastodon fossil will eventually go on display.

On August 12, 2016 the Supreme Court had directed all dealers and manufacturers to deposit 1% levy of ex-showroom price for every diesel car and SUV with engine capacity 2000cc and above sold in Delhi-NCR as environment protection charge. The CPCB was directed to open bank accounts where the money could be deposited. ?More than Rs 35 crore has already been deposited over the past one year. We have submitted a proposal to National Green Tribunal on how to use the money. As the entire money was collected from Delhi-NCR as per directions of the Supreme Court, it would be spent solely to better tackle air pollution in the region only,? said the official. Even though several countries in the US and Europe have already developed such city specific driving cycles to tackle air pollution, India is yet to come up with a driving cycle. ?This is a very good proposal. If we get to know the driving cycle of Delhi it would help us to bring down the pollution levels by doing away with those elements on the roads which cause pollution,? said Kamal Soi member of the National Road Safety Council. The CPCB is also planning to take the help of more advanced monitoring systems such as satellite imageries, sensor-based instrument and strengthen its existing ambient air quality and noise monitoring network with the accumulated fund. According the proposal submitted to the NGT plans are also afoot to install LED display screens in some locations for creating awareness among the citizens on the rising air pollution levels of Delhi. ?We would also invite  expression of interest where in research activities on how to retrofit vehicles with advanced technologies and alternate cleaner fuels could be funded,? the CPCB official said.

Notably, Dhirubhai Ambani is regarded as father of India's capital markets.","Mumbai, Jun 29 (PTI) Leading businessman Anil Ambani today said more than creating wealth for himself, his father late Dhirubhai Ambani derived greater happiness from creating wealth for masses. ""If you ever asked what part of being an entrepreneur he (late Ambani) enjoyed the most, he would say, I enjoy creating wealth. But what I enjoy even more is in creating wealth for the people of the country,"" the Anil Ambani Group chairman said while addressing an industry event here. It can be noted that the late Ambani, who had a humble beginning as a primary school teachers son in Gujarat, is regarded as the father of capital markets and the equity cult, who made millions of investors millionaires with the IPO of Reliance Textile Industries in 1977. A person who had put in Rs 1,000 then in the IPO is worth over a million today, going by the price of RIL. Stating that the launch of Kothari Pioneer Mutual Fund, which was countrys first private MF in 1993, was his (Dhirubhais) idea of achieving wealth creation for the masses, Anil said the launch of Reliance MF in 1995 was an added effort to achieve the same. He claimed that the launch of Reliance Growth and Reliance Vision funds in 1995 is justifiably regarded as a watershed event in the history of mutual funds in the country as these brought millions of retail investors into the capital markets and generated unprecedented wealth for them. He said Reliance MF has grown from an AUM (assets under management) of under Rs 60 crore in 1995 and Rs 2,200 crore in 2002 to Rs 2.25 trillion now, which is an over 100 times of growth, while the total AUM of the AMC (asset management company) currently is Rs 3.58 trillion. At the same time, the domestic mutual fund industry, with 5.7 crore individual accounts, has expanded its AUM to reach Rs 20 trillion. Describing free markets as the best invention, Ambani said that of all earthly inventions, the free market is perhaps the greatest force for economic good in human history. Hailing the governments focus on financial inclusion, he said the national rollout of JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and mobile-as-digital-platform) has prepared the ground for bringing hundreds of millions of unbanked and excluded citizens into the financial system.

In an exclusive conversation with India Today, the party's former general secretary, Amar Singh, said that the Samajwadi Party has a dark future without its leader, Mulayam Singh Yadav.  Amar Singh was dismissed from the SP just ahead of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election as the Yadav clan was embroiled in a bitter tussle to control the party. He claims to have snapped all ties with his political mentor.Reacting to the exit of two party legislators from the UP Upper House, Amar Singh said,""I am not happy at what's happening to the party which I raised with so much hard work and I am also not responding to any calls from Mulayam Singh Yadav since I was ousted twice from the Samajwadi Party and humiliated.""He says, ""Samajwadi Party is gone with the wind.

3544,"HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh has said, ""I will call this year's Budget an affordable housing budget,"" adding, the government is focusing on ""practical and realistic steps"" which are good for developers, consumers, and lenders. ""I am very excited about housing growth in India in next 3-5 years and I have never been so enthused about it,"" Parekh added.","Mumbai, Apr 30 (PTI) A large number of big corporates and reputed developers are entering the affordable housing segment, attracted by huge tax benefits and reforms initiated by the government, eminent banker Deepak Parekh has said. He also expressed hope that real estate prices would decline more once RBI allows banks and housing finance firms to lend to developers for land purchases and approval processes for projects are further streamlined and shortened. Lauding the NDA government for coordinated efforts of the Prime Ministers Office with various ministries and departments on the Housing for All by 2022 mission, Parekh said this has been one of the main promises made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several steps have been taken, especially this year, to achieve this goal. ""I will call this years Budget an affordable housing budget. I am very excited about housing growth in India in next 3-5 years and I have never been so enthused about it,"" Parekh told PTI in an interview. Parekh, Chairman of housing finance major HDFC Ltd, said the government is focusing on ""practical and realistic steps"" which are good for developers, consumers and even the lenders. Speaking in detail about various schemes and measures, Parekh said the government has extended the 100 per cent tax deduction scheme for affordable housing projects approved between June 2016 and March 2019, by two more years till 2021. ""What this effectively means is that any developer, for affordable housing project, has to pay zero tax. I do not know of any industry in India where you have to pay zero tax even if you make profit, other than in affordable housing. ""It shows the importance, the urgency and the critical need that housing requires in a vast country like ours,"" he said. Parekh also said that a clear carpet area definition has been put in place for affordable housing units -- 30 sq meters in four metros and 60 square meters for rest of the country. ""They have also made it clear that these measurements are for municipal limits, so areas like Navi Mumbai and Thane would not have Mumbai limit of 30 sq mt. The business leader said the infrastructure status to affordable housing is another major benefit that builders have been given by the government and this will help lenders too. ""This means they can take long-term funds from institutions such as insurers and pension funds. Insurance firms and pension funds need to invest certain portion of their money in infrastructure sector and the affordable housing now qualifies for those funds. ""The RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Act) and these new measures will also stop the practice of builders taking full money in advance from the customers and then building the project entirely on the basis of customers money. ""The tax benefit is attracting builders in a big way to affordable housing. We have seen big builders in big cities approaching us that they want to get into affordable housing. We are supporting the builders for getting into affordable housing,"" he said. Talking about other steps that would give a big fillip to the sector, he said the housing loan interest subsidy scheme is a game changer that gives subsidy of up to 6.5 per cent. The scheme was initially launched for EWS/LIG but now has been modified and extended to MIG also which is a very good step. ""There are 3-4 other things which the government has done. Holding of property is down to 2 years to qualify as a long term capital asset,"" he said. On other good provisions, Parekh said when a builder earlier had unsold flats in a completed project, the notional rent was taxed on these unsold flats from the year in which the project was completed. Now, notional rent of properties will be taken as nil for one year from the date of obtaining completion certificate.

349,The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a plea seeking its nod for terminating the 32-week-old pregnancy of a 10-year-old rape victim. The SC made the decision after taking note of a medical report stating that abortion was neither good for the girl nor the foetus. It is prohibited to terminate any pregnancy in India after 20 weeks without court's permission.n,"The Supreme Court noted on Friday a sharp rise in pleas from women seeking to abort pregnancies beyond the legally permissible time limit while rejecting a 10-year-old rape survivor?s request to terminate her 32-week pregnancy. Medical opinion placed before the court said the abortion would not be in the interest of either the girl or the foetus.A bench headed by Chief Justice JS Khehar asked the central government to consider setting up a permanent medical board in every state to quickly decide on pleas from pregnant women asking for terminations beyond the permissible 20-week period. The bench said these boards were needed to save time because such cases were coming to the courts in a ?big way?.This year, the Supreme Court has received at least seven petitions from women, including teenage rape survivors, asking to terminate pregnancies beyond 20 weeks. The top court disallowed abortions in two, including Friday?s, lawyers said.Courts allow terminations beyond that in the rarest of circumstances if doctors say it is necessary to save the mother?s life.Friday?s order came after the court perused the report of an expert panel set up by the PGI, Chandigarh, to find out ?whether the health of the girl concerned and the child would be adversely affected if the pregnancy is allowed to be full term?.The bench expressed satisfaction over the medical care being provided to the rape survivor and dismissed the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a lawyer seeking the abortion.To the court?s suggestion on setting up permanent medical boards in states, solicitor general Ranjit Kumar said he would inform the court whether such boards can operate while amendments to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (MTPA), 1971, considered extending the time-limit from 20 to 24 weeks.The girl, who hails from Chandigarh, was repeatedly raped by her uncle. Her parents were poor and had approached the Chandigarh district court for permission to terminate the pregnancy. On July 18, the court dismissed the plea, citing the 20-week ceiling. A lawyer then went to the top court.The girl was allegedly raped over seven months. Her parents got to know of it when they took her to a doctor after she complained of a stomach pain, her parents said.In another case a bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra allowed a 21-year-old woman from Mumbai to abort her 22-week-old foetus following a medical opinion that post-birth the child will have severe mental impairment.A three-member panel of experts from JJ Hospital concluded the foetus suffered from Hydrocephalus, or accumulation of fluid in the brain. The court asked the woman to approach JJ Hospital for the termination, which it said should be done soon.

2853,"Doctors at various hospitals have claimed that a large number of parents are demanding disability certificates for their children to get admission in schools. They added that in several cases, there is no disability. According to one doctor, parents even say that their child doesn't want to study Science, and request for an appropriate certificate. ","With school and college admissions being the flavour of season, doctors of city's top government hospitals are battling a rush of people with requests for issuance of disability certificates.Demands for disability certificates by parents and students come shortly after the Union government revised the disability act and made it mandatory for government hospitals to issue a differently -abled certificate. Previous disability certificates issued by private doctors are invalid now.A large number of parents are approaching RML doctors. The psychiatry department at the central government hospital is flooded with demands for disability certificates for students.MISUSEIn several case, experts diagnosed students with disability certificates with no disability. ""It is strange to find that even though the child is ineligible to get a disability certificate, top private practitioners' at leading hospitals have issued the same to him. It is a complete misuse,"" said a senior psychiatrist at RML requesting anonymity.Dr Smita Desphande, who heads the department of Psychiatry at RML Hospital told Mail Today, ""Our department has been getting at least 10 cases each day, wherein parents ask for disability certificate for their child to get admission done under the disability quota. Parents thus want their children to be categorised under any sort of disability- be it autism, intellectual disability or speech disorder.""Parents mostly come with their kids complaining Specific Learning Disability (SLD). If doctors approve, the child gets an extra hour for writing and preparing for CBSE, entrance and university exams. Mostly, requests come for students of private schools and colleges.ANYTHING FOR MARKS""Parents know disability certificates would fetch their kids marks, even if the spelling is wrong, and would allot them extra time during exams. Often they come to us saying, 'My child does not want to take up Science, so make the certificate according to requirements,"" said a doctor.""We have a specific tool to calculate the percentage of disability in a child. And when the assessment tool fails to identify any disability, parents force us to still issue a certificate. We were surprised to see that two leading private hospitals in Delhi have made forged disability certificates - which is unethical,"" said a senior psychiatrist at RML. Teachers, according to experts and doctors, are unaware of disability norms.RML doctors said parents are misguided by school teachers often.""There is very poor awareness in teachers. We get the reference from school teachers who ask us to get the certificate done for so and so and our department has been receiving an increasing number of referral case. There is a need for special educators in schools.""If a child is found to be not falling under the disabled category completely and is rather differently abled, with 5-10 per cent of disabilty, we provide that particular certificate and also often try to help them improve by intervention or speech therapy. We try to provide them whatever, treatment is required,"" said Dr Desphande.Last month, Mail Today had reported that that the Centre is bringing in 14 new categories of physical and mental conditions, under the ambit of the Disability Act, 2006. At present, the act provides the disability rights and benefits to seven special categories of people comprising blindness, low-vision, locomotive disability, hearing impairment, mental retardation, mental illness and leprosy.The new conditions will apply to people with cerebral palsy, dwarfism, muscular dystrophy, specific learning disabilities, deafness, autism, spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, haemophilia, thalassemia, sickle cell disease, multiple disabilities (condition of any two disabilities or more) and acidattack survivors.Ministry officials said the previous Right of Persons with Disabilities Act 1995, mentions only seven categories including people having 40 per cent and above disability, providing them all benefits.In 2001, disability assessment guidelines were prepared for these categories, but there was no measure to calculate the percentage of disability in a person. ""The ministry therefore formed a committee to review how to assess and measure the exiting as well as the proposed disability percentage in a person and accordingly entitlements would be given to the person,"" an official said.

948,"Pakistan's Supreme Court on Monday began hearings on the Panama Papers case against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. This comes after the SC-appointed Joint Investigation Team (JIT) panel found the country's leader guilty of financial irregularities including tax evasion. The court is expected to put Sharif on trial on corruption charges or disqualify him, however, Sharif has denied any wrongdoing.","Pakistan?s supreme court has begun hearings that will decide the future of the prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, who is fighting for his job and contesting a damning corruption report by an investigative panel. The supreme court is expected to order Sharif be tried Sharif on corruption charges, or disqualify him, but few expect the judges to dismiss the case after the panel tabled a damaging 254-page report into his family wealth. Sharif has denied any wrongdoing after the report alleged his family?s vast wealth was beyond their means and accused his children, including presumed heir Maryam, of signing forged documents to obscure ownership of four flats in London?s Mayfair. Sharif, 67, has rejected demands by opposition parties to resign, warning his replacement would destabilise the country and imperil hard-won economic gains since his poll victory in 2013.?It hurts that despite all of our hard work, attempts are afoot once again to push the country back,? Sharif told a meeting of his ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party at the weekend.In April Sharif narrowly escaped disqualification after the supreme court ruled there was insufficient evidence to remove him ? by a 2-3 split ? over documents released by the Panama Papers leak into offshore wealth. But it ordered further investigations, and the formation of the joint investigation team (JIT) panel. Sharif has talked of a conspiracy against him, but has not named anyone. His allies, however, privately claim that elements of Pakistan?s powerful military and the judiciary are bent on toppling him. The army spokesman brushed aside questions about claims the military?s hidden hand was the driving force behind the JIT investigation, saying ?the Pakistan army is not directly connected?. The six-person JIT panel included one member from the military intelligence agency and another from the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate, the country?s top spy agency. Sharif, the son of an industrialist, is serving his third term in power and has had a fractious relationship with the army. He was originally nurtured by the military as a civilian politician who would protect their interests, and he served as prime minister twice in the 1990s. But relations soured and his second stint as prime minister ended when he was ousted in a 1999 coup leading to a decade of exile. Relations with the military during the current term have also been tense. Sharif?s legal team and the opposition will be given a chance to contest the JIT findings and Sharif is also expected to be summoned to appear before the court in coming days or weeks. Opposition politicians say Sharif is concocting claims of conspiracy to save his skin and argue that if he really wanted to protect democracy he should step down. Imran Khan, the opposition leader who pushed the hardest for Sharif to be investigated, said the prime minister would end up in jail, and vowed protests if he was not ousted by the court. ?Either we will celebrate in Islamabad or otherwise we will hit the streets to save our democracy and to make sure we send this mafia to Adiyala jail,? Khan told supporters.",23,"Pakistan's Supreme Court on Monday began hearings on the Panama Papers case against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

","Power distribution companies will now have to procure more green energy or electricity generated from renewable sources.The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) has issued a new regulation according to which discoms will either have to generate their own electricity through renewable sources or increase their purchase of green energy from generating companies.The draft rules termed as the ?DERC (Renewable Purchase Obligation and Renewable Energy Certificate Framework Implementation) Regulations, 2017 will also make it compulsory for discoms to buy 100% electricity being generated from the waste-to-energy (WTE) plants set up in the Capital. Currently, Delhi has four WTE plants. ?The distribution licensees shall compulsorily procure 100% power produced from all the Waste-to-Energy plants in the State, in the ratio of their procurement of power from all sources including their own as approved by the Commission from time to time, which shall qualify towards compliance of Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) for the Distribution Licensee,? read the draft regulations for which comments from public are being sought. People can send their comments to the commission till August 15.?The annual target for RPO required to be met by the discoms shall be notified by the dommission in the tariff order that is likely to be announced in September,? a DERC official said. The DERC in October 2012 had notified regulations making RPO compulsory for all discoms in the city. RPOs make it mandatory for all discoms to purchase some percentage of electricity through renewable sources of energy. In 2016-17, the discoms had to get 9% of their total electricity from renewables and in 2015-16 it was 7.6%.However, since 2012, the power regulator had only been carrying it forward to the next financial year as discoms had repeatedly failed to meet the RPOs.As a result, by the year 2015, the defaulting amount has risen up to almost 15 per cent of the total electricity procured by the companies.After defaulting on RPOs for years and with the Aam Aadmi Party government notifying the Delhi Solar Policy, the city?s three discoms have now pulled up their socks. Tata Power procured 400 MW of solar power and Reliance Infra-backed BSES announced it would procure 700 MW ?green energy? for the city.BSES, which distributes power to 70 per cent of the areas in Delhi, has decided to procure both solar and non-solar power at under Rs5 per unit through the ?reverse auction? route to ensure an ?extremely competitive? rate to benefit consumers.",21,"The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) has directed power distribution companies in Delhi to either generate their own electricity through renewable sources or increase their purchase of green energy from generating companies.

3738,"According to the book titled 'Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton's Doomed Campaign', Hillary Clinton phoned her presidential election opponent Donald Trump to say ""congratulations, Donald"" after her loss. She added, ""I'll be supportive of the country's success, and your success as president"". Clinton also called former President Barack Obama and apologised to him for the loss, the book revealed.","As the first polls closed on 8 November, Hillary Clinton was preparing for the moment she would at long last take the stage as the first female president of the United States.She instead found herself apologizing to Barack Obama hours later in a harrowing phone call, moments after conceding the presidential election to Donald Trump.?Mr President, I?m sorry,? Clinton told Obama, who had contacted her to extend his condolences for her loss.The phone call is one of several revelations in the new book Shattered, in which the journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes chronicle Clinton?s 18-month quest to do what eluded her in 2008 and break ?that highest, hardest glass ceiling?.The book sheds particular light on the painful turn of events on election night, as Clinton watched the returns deviate dramatically from the path her campaign had so confidently predicted. Surrounded by family and aides at the Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan, she saw the first cracks emerge as the must-win state of Florida turned dicey. Steve Schale, among the most reliable Democratic strategists in the state, informed Clinton?s campaign they were short on votes.As other battlegrounds began to crumble, a sober mood took hold in the suite. But soon, the authors wrote, aides began to blame each other as Bill Clinton grew increasingly upset and Hillary Clinton became withdrawn.It was Obama, taking in the results with his own advisers in Washington, who broke up the slumber with a series of phone calls from the White House. Wisconsin, a Democratic stronghold, had just been called for Trump. Some states remained excruciatingly close, but the president was convinced of the outcome and did not want to question the legitimacy of the election as Trump had done just weeks earlier while facing off against Clinton in the debates.?You need to concede,? Obama told Clinton after his political director had failed to persuade Clinton?s campaign manager, Robby Mook, on the point.It took one more phone call from the president ? to Clinton?s campaign chairman, John Podesta ? before she asked her close aide Huma Abedin for the phone and uttered the words she never thought she would say: ?Congratulations, Donald. ?I?ll be supportive of the country?s success, and that means your success as president,? Clinton said.It was after her brief conversation with Trump that Clinton apologized to Obama.The book is the second collaboration for Allen and Parnes, who in 2014 authored HRC, a detailed account of Clinton?s tenure at the helm of the state department, in anticipation of her second presidential run. As the first take on Clinton?s doomed campaign, they offer a behind-the-scenes view of the obstacles in her way ? some familiar and others a consequence of the shifting American electorate. There is the familiar tension between the old guard that has for decades operated ?Clintonworld? and the new blood that labored in Brooklyn to reinvent the campaign of one of the most well-known public figures in the world. The authors revisit the unexpected challenge from Bernie Sanders, whose insurgent campaign captured the wave of economic populism sweeping the country. The infighting amid the Democratic primaries, as Team Clinton struggled to decisively put away the senator, is a dominant theme of the book?s first half.And then there are the emails.The aftermath of Clinton?s decision to use a private email server as secretary of state, and subsequent discord among her inner circle over how to respond, is retold with the benefit of hindsight. We learn that Bill Clinton did not believe she should apologize, as neither he nor she felt there had been any wrongdoing.Clinton eventually did apologize to the public in August 2015, six months after the server issue was first brought to light.The role of Russian interference in the US election, now the subject of three investigations in Washington, is barely explored in the book, although the authors do say that Clinton?s former aides see it as one of the main reasons for her loss.The effects of Trump?s nationalist campaign are also relegated to the backseat, as this is a story primarily told through how Clinton?s campaign adapted (or sometimes crucially didn?t) to the evolving political climate. Staffers were confident in their sophisticated voter modeling and analytics, and fatally failed to spot when they veered off target.Clinton, for her part, carried a lingering doubt throughout the campaign. ?Why aren?t they with me?? she asked of working class white people during the Democratic primaries. ?Why can?t we bring them onboard??It was a question her campaign never quite answered.",40,"According to the book titled 'Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton's Doomed Campaign', Hillary Clinton phoned her presidential election opponent Donald Trump to say ""congratulations, Donald"" after her loss.
